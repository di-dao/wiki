description: Sonr Changelog Feburary 2023
---

The final software upgrade for our DevNet chain has been deployed, and we're all in on transitioning to TestNet! This release builds on the "rebuilt from scratch" announced on [January 17, 2023](https://sonr-hq.productlane.io/changelog/17-01-2023).

## ➡ Highlights

- **IPFS Gateway** and Resolver Deployed!
- **UCAN** Storage **Encryption**
- Tightened **x/identity** and **Cosmos SDK Integration**
- Standardized Type Definitions
- **Cosmos** **Signature** **Authentication** (Next Step IBC)
- _...and introducing **ETHAccount**, and **BTCAccount** interfaces!_

## ➡ Generic Blockchain Accounts

There's little dispute that we will live in a Multi-Chain future. The Sonr MPC protocol offers a Decentralized Solution to the traditional onboarding mechanism in Web3, greatly alleviating user friction points. Our latest release has begun migrating our Account Interface to allow for custom transaction signing implementations. This includes the initial development of accounts for **BitCoin** and **Ethereum.**

So far, we have incorporated the following hashing functions:

- **_Keccak-256_** (Ethereum)
- **_SHA-256_** (Bitcoin)
- **_BLAKE-3_** (Sonr Authentication)

## What's Next?

The primary focus of our next upgrade _(Venus)_ is to coordinate the launch of our Testnet to the general developer audience. We anticipate reaching this goal by the end of March - Early April. Outside of what's on [our roadmap,](https://roadmap.sonr.io/) we will be prioritizing these initiatives:

- IBC Integration and Cosmos Hub Testnet Interactions
- Interchain Account Support with DIDDocuments
- Rosetta Client Implementation for Generic Accounts
- Upgrade Motor API to support x/identity
