We are pleased to announce the completion of Client Storage Buckets implementation over IPFS and Highway Protocol. This update brings enhanced functionality and increased security to our platform. Here's a brief overview of the key features:

1. **Highway Protocol Integration:** We have integrated the Highway Protocol, a peer-to-peer networking solution that facilitates secure, efficient, and reliable communication among nodes in the network.
2. **UCAN Spec Integration:** The User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN) specification has been integrated into our platform, allowing users to delegate control and access to their IPFS resources securely.
3. **DID Document-based Token Issuance:** We have incorporated Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) into our token issuance process, allowing for a more secure and streamlined management of user identities and their associated digital assets.

This update marks an important milestone in our ongoing commitment to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform for decentralized identity and digital asset management. We look forward to continuing to enhance and expand our offerings in the future.

## UCAN ❤️ Sonr

The [UCAN Specification](https://ucan.xyz/) by the [Fission Labs](https://fission.codes/) team was a stunningly seamless integration within the Sonr DID Spec. Documents can Issue/Verify Claims and create Attestation/Origin Tokens - all while using JWKs as an authorization header for the Vault API endpoints. We plan to utilize the [recent WebTransport](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-webtransport) implementation by the [Libp2p team](https://libp2p.io/) for the upcoming motor.js.
