description: Sonr Changelog January 2023
---

We are excited to announce the (soft launch) of our latest module for our Cosmos Blockchain. Sonr is a self-sovereign data platform that enables developers to build user-centric, privacy-preserving applications, all secured by a Cosmos-powered blockchain.

Sonr utilizes DID documents, Webauthn, IPFS, and multi-party computation, to provide a fully decentralized mechanism for identity and crypto asset management. This allows developers to create user-friendly and secure applications while ensuring users maintain control of their data and assets.

The x/identity module results from the culmination of multiple existing elements in the Sonr component stack. By leveraging the default P2P nature, we were able to optimize our "Decentralized-Wallet-As-A-Service" significantly.

- **180% Faster** - \*Execution Time dropped on all tests from roughly 40s to >2s **(huge news!!)\***
- **150M+ Encryption Parameters** - _Secure IPFS Storage_
- **Much better Web Support** - _Libp2p over gRPC, HTTP, and WebTransport_

## Features

- Implement x/Identity Module Query Methods
- Implement x/Identity Keeper gRPC Message Service
- Support CGGMP Algorithm
- Build Host Interface for MPC Online Network
- Create Motor Interface for Interacting with Remote P2P Peer
