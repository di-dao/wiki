title: "ADR-002: Decentralized Identity Specification"
description: Sonr aims to enhance digital identity by aligning with W3C specifications for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The proposal focuses on implementing DIDs, preventing association of 3rd-party identification with wallets, and eliminating seed-phrases for onboarding. The x/identity module manages DIDDocuments on-chain and resolves private user identifiers off-chain. Additional features include multi-party computation for enhanced security and privacy, and interblockchain communication for interoperability. The proposal is currently under development by the Sonr Team, with a target completion in Q4 2023.
