This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._


Sonr's decentralized, realtime network provides Web3 developers with a tool-set that to quickly deploy scalable Web3 applications, with verifiable data that can be reused and shared across all Sonr powered applications.

- **Developer Experience** - We believe application development should be as straight forward as possible. Sonr's SDK's is an all-in-one solution for developing applications for the Sonr network. We believe in consistency and openness, as our libraries are built on open standards.
- **Composable by Design** - Our protocols are flexible and are capable of wrapping custom protocols. These protocols are extendable and support merging, which allows for reusability and composability.


## Getting started

To get started, register a new service in your [cli instance](https://github.com/sonr-io/sonr), then read about how to make requests for the resources you need to access using our HTTP APIs or dedicated client SDKs. When your service is ready to go live, publish it to our [blockchain testnet](https://rpc.sonr.ws) to reach the Sonr ecosystem.

		What is the Sonr stack?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>

#### Network
We've built a global decentralized network that leverages our breakthrough identity module allowing for device based authentication, realtime content delivery, and true digital asset ownership. Users are provided the promised utility of Web3 without any lagging experience.

#### Client SDKs

The Sonr Motor node is an end to end client suite which provides all the features of our Network in an easily approachable SDK. Motor offers the easiest consumer onboarding experience in Web3 by stripping away seed phrases, and introducing multi-party computation for Quantum computing resistant encryption.

#### Blockchain

The Blockchain is the perfect marriage for Sonr's global decentralized network. With Cosmos, we can quickly and easily connect to other blockchains, providing our users with the ability to build interoperable experiences. IBC is the perfect specification for cross-chain communication, and GravityBridge provides us with the perfect way to bridge to Ethereum. Sonrâ€™s blockchain also provides developer with the peace of mind of knowing that user data is securely distributed across IPFS with a native bridge to Filecoin.

What is limiting crypto adoption?
</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

There are several factors that may prevent the widespread adoption of web3 mobile apps. Some of the main challenges and barriers to the adoption of web3 mobile apps include:
              - Limited awareness and understanding of web3 and decentralized technologies among the general public
              - Limited adoption of decentralized technologies and infrastructure by developers and businesses
              - Limited availability of user-friendly web3 mobile apps and tools
              - Limited scalability and performance of decentralized networks and applications
              - Regulatory uncertainty and potential legal challenges

	Where can I use DID's?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
It is possible that DIDs (decentralized IDs) could eventually replace traditional forms of authentication, such as username and password combinations, in the future. DIDs are a key component of the decentralized identity (DID) ecosystem, which is being developed to provide individuals and organizations with control over their own digital identities and data. DIDs are designed to be secure, decentralized, and interoperable, and can be used to represent a wide range of identity-related information in a secure and decentralized way.

The use of DIDs for authentication has several potential benefits over traditional forms of authentication. For example, DIDs can provide a more secure and decentralized way to authenticate users, as they are stored on a decentralized ledger (such as a blockchain) and can be accessed and verified by anyone with the appropriate permissions. This can help to improve the security and privacy of online authentication, and can reduce the risk of identity theft and other security threats. DIDs can also be more user-friendly and convenient for users, as they can be easily accessed and managed using a variety of different devices and applications.

	What was the Internets original vision?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has expressed a vision for the future of the internet that emphasizes decentralization, interoperability, and user control. In this vision, the internet would be a more open, transparent, and democratic platform, where users have more control over their own data and online experiences.

Berners-Lee has referred to this vision as the "POD" (Personal Online Data) model, and has described it as a way to "take back the web" from the large technology companies that currently dominate the internet landscape. In the POD model, users would be able to store their own data on personal servers or other decentralized storage systems,
and would be able to control who has access to that data. This would enable users to have more control over their own data and online experiences, and would help to reduce the concentration of power and control in the hands of a few large technology companies.
