Messages are what conversations are made of in Protocol â€” they are the basic building blocks of your conversations with your Protocol contacts. On this page, we'll dive into the different message endpoints you can use to manage messages programmatically. We'll look at how to query, send, update, and delete messages.

## The message model

The message model contains all the information about the messages and attachments you send to your contacts and groups, including how your contacts have reacted to them.
