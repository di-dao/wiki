Services are essential components in the Sonr peer-to-peer identity and asset management system. They store information about various services provided by developer applications. On this page, we'll dive into the different Service Record endpoints you can use to manage Service Records programmatically. We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete Service Records.

## The Service Record
The Service Record model contains all the information about the services provided by developer applications, including the controller, type, origin, and associated endpoints.
