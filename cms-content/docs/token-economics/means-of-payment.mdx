# Means of Payment

On Sonr’s blockchain all transactional operations are for either managing a user’s account or a application configuration. This is to maintain a distributed ledger of users and the apps they can interact with to ensure an open decentralized standard for the user owned internet.

## Highway Modules

The Sonr Highway modules are the core building blocks for creating decentralized, privacy-preserving, and user orientated apps. Each module corresponds with an associated blockchain keeper which allows developers to perform the inputed action.

### Registry

The registry module houses our standard for User and Application identification. We utilize the combined encryption technology native to the user’s devices to secure their identity effectively on the internet without the use of passwords and seed phrases.

- **Creating a User**
- **Modifying User Account**
- **Registering an Application**
- **Updating Application Settings**
- **Buying an Alias**
- **Listing an Alias for Sale**
- **Transferring an Alias**

### Schema

The schema module records all the type definitions in a particular application powered by the Sonr Network. It provides a reliable way for nodes to be able to resolve and utilize data types across the network in a verifiable and decentralized way.

- **Defining a Schema**
- **Updating a Schema**
- **Deleting a Schema**
- **Classify Schema into NFT Collection**
- **Modifying the Schema Classification**
- **Minting NFT from Schema**
- **Burning Existing NFTs**
- **Updating a User’s NFT Properties**

### Bucket

The bucket module handles the records of all IPFS based encrypted storage folders that interact with nodes across the network. This includes serving Key Vaults, reading/writing to App Buckets, and sending messages to Mailboxes.

- **Generating a App, Mailbox, or Vault Bucket**
- **Updating a Buckets Settings**
- **Deleting a Bucket**

### Channel — *Planned*

The channel module manages the records of persistent data streams registered to an application in Sonr. We will be leveraging the Group module to handle

- **Registering a Schema-Based PubSub, **or **Protocol-Based Channel**
- **Updating a Channel Configuration**
- **Deleting a Channel**
- **Classifying a Group from Channel Members**
- **Update Group Members**
- **Leave Group**
