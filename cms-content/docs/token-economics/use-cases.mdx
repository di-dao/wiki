# Use Cases

The **price** of a token is the exchange rate of the token for fiat. The **value** of the token can be modeled in terms of fundamental demand drivers and effective supply. The **demand** of the token is driven by the **property rights granted by the token**, and the effective **supply** is driven by the **number of tokens to which a specific set of rights are granted**.

```text
$$
\text{Token Price \textbf{(SNR)}} = \text{\underline{Fundamental Value}} + \text{\textbf{Token Specific} Non-Fundamentals} + \text{\textbf{Market/Industry} Non-Fundamentals}
$$
```

**Token-Specific Non-Fundamentals** are every external price shocks which only effect the Sonr Token. They are the result of either marketing or pure luck, for example:

- Super Bowl Ad
- Viral Marketing Campaign with “How much big tech owes you”
- Elon Musk tweeting about us

**Market/Industry Non-Fundamentals** are driven by the total blockchain industry at large. These shifts in  sentiment create price shocks which impact every network. Some recent examples include:

- 2021 NFT Bull Run
- 2022 Crypto Crash
