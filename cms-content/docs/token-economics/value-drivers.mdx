# Value Drivers

The Fundamental value of a payment token is derived from the economic activity conducted in tokens, circulating token supply, and token velocity. *Velocity* is the measure of the number of times a token is spent on average per period.

## Value of a Single

This phrase refers to the value of a payment token in a single period.

```text
$$
v = \frac{\text{Economic activity conducted in tokens}}  {\text{Circulating token supply} *\text{Token Velocity}}
$$
```

### **Economic activity**

This captures the total amount spent on goods and services for a fixed period of time, essentially GDP. Economic Activity depends on:

- Total transaction fees paid in tokens
- Purchases of goods and services paid in tokens
- Maximizing economic activity *is different* from maximizing value creation in the ecosystem

### **Circulating token supply**

Token supply in circulation depends on:

- Tokens in circulation at launch
- Newley-minted tokens
- Tokens released from vesting
- Tokens taken out of circulation
