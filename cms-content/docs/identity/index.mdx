# Using Identities

Identities are a way to manage your identity on Protocol. They are a collection of keys that can be used to sign transactions and messages. Identities are stored in a local database on your computer, and can be exported and imported to other computers.

```javascript
import { Identities } from "@arkecosystem/crypto";
```
