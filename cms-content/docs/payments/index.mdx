## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

```bash:Terminal
npx create-next-app@latest
```

## Main Features

Some of the main Next.js features include:

1. **Routing** - A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.
2. **Rendering** - Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes.
3. **Data Fetching** - Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended `fetch` API for request memoization, data caching and revalidation.
4. **Styling** - Support for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS
5. **Optimizations** - Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals and User Experience.
6. **TypeScript** - Improved support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker.

## How to Use These Docs

On the left side of the screen, you'll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K).

To get started, checkout the Installation guide.

## Accessibility

For optimal accessibility when using a screen reader while reading the docs, we recommend using Firefox and NVDA, or Safari and VoiceOver.
