The Bank module in the Cosmos SDK is a core module that provides basic transaction and account management functionality. It allows developers to create and manage accounts, transfer funds between accounts, and track the total supply of tokens on the blockchain.

The Bank module is essential for building applications that involve the transfer of value, such as decentralized exchanges, payment networks, and stablecoins.
