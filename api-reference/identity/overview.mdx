The Identity module in Sonr's Cosmos powered blockchain is a core module that provides basic DID document management functionality. It allows users to create and manage their own DID documents, store them on the blockchain, and share them with others as needed.

The x/identity module is essential for building applications that incorporate decentralized identity management, such as decentralized identity networks, social networks, and financial platforms. It is designed to be easily integrable with other modules in the Cosmos SDK, allowing developers to build complex, decentralized applications with ease.

Additionally, the x/identity module is fully compliant with the W3C DID specification, ensuring compatibility with other DID implementations and standards.
