Tendermint is a core component of the Cosmos SDK, a modular framework for building blockchains. It is a high-performance consensus engine that provides the underlying infrastructure for the Cosmos blockchain.

Tendermint uses a BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) algorithm to achieve consensus among the nodes in the network, ensuring that the blockchain is secure and consistent. It also provides a p2p networking layer, allowing nodes to communicate and share data with each other.

Tendermint is designed to be scalable, fast, and secure, making it an essential component of the Cosmos SDK and the broader Cosmos ecosystem.
