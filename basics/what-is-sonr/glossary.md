<details>

<summary><strong><code>Decentralized Identity</code></strong></summary>

An identity system where individuals have control over their personal data and how it's shared.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Decentralized Storage</code></strong></summary>

A system that stores data across a distributed network of nodes, ensuring data redundancy and availability.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)</code></strong></summary>

A consensus mechanism where token holders vote for validators to secure the network.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong><code>DID</code></strong></summary>

Decentralized Identifier, a globally unique and persistent identifier for a person, organization, or thing.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>DID Controller</code></summary>

An entity that has the capability to make changes to a DID Document, essentially having control over the DID.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong><code>DID Document</code></strong></summary>

A JSON-LD document containing metadata associated with a DID, such as public keys and service endpoints.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>DID Method</code></summary>

Specifies the syntax and procedures for specific DID schemes. It defines how to read, write and resolve DIDs for a particular blockchain or storage network.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>DID Resolver</code></summary>

A system function that takes a DID as input and produces a DID Document as output, essentially translating the identifier into a form that the system can process.

</details>

## E

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES)</code></strong></summary>

A hybrid encryption scheme that uses elliptic curve cryptography for key agreement and symmetric encryption for data encapsulation.

</details>

## H

<details>

<summary><strong><code>HTMX</code></strong></summary>

A library that allows you to access modern browser features directly from HTML, without using JavaScript.

</details>

## I

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Interblockchain Communication (IBC)</code></strong></summary>

A protocol that enables reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication between heterogeneous blockchains.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Interchain Accounts</code></strong></summary>

A module in the Cosmos SDK that enables an account on one blockchain to control an account on another blockchain.

</details>

## J

<details>

<summary><strong><code>JWT</code></strong></summary>



</details>

## K

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Keyshare</code></strong></summary>

A portion of a private key that is distributed among multiple parties in a secure multi-party computation scheme.

</details>

## M

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Matrix Protocol</code></strong></summary>

An open standard for secure, decentralized, real-time communication, providing a P2P routing layer.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</code></strong></summary>

A cryptographic protocol that allows parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping them private.

</details>

## P

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Passkeys</code></strong></summary>

Secure, anonymous WebAuthn-based credentials for privacy-preserving, user-friendly authentication.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Pinecone</code></strong></summary>

A P2P routing layer in the Matrix Protocol that enables efficient message routing between embedded clients.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>PublicKeyAssertion</code></summary>

**PublicKeyAssertion** in WebAuthn is cryptographic proof of private key possession to verify identity without passwords.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>PublicKeyAttestation</code></summary>

PublicKeyAttestation in WebAuthn verifies a credential's authenticity via an attestation statement from the authenticator.

</details>

## R

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Relaying Party</code></strong></summary>

An entity that relies upon a verifiable credential or authenticated identity during a transaction.

</details>

## S

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Self-Sovereign Identity</code></strong></summary>

A model where individuals have sole ownership and control over their digital identities.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong><code>Service Record</code></strong></summary>
