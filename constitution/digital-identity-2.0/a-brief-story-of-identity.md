# A Brief Story of Identity

### Web1 Identifiers (1990s)

In the early days of the internet known as Web1:

* Digital identity was limited and decentralized
* People used anonymous usernames or email addresses to identify themselves
* There were no widespread standards or protocols for proving one's identity online

### Web2 Identifiers (2000s)

As the internet became more advanced in the Web2 era:

* Centralized identity providers emerged like Google, Facebook, Twitter
* Single sign-on allowed using one identity across multiple websites
* This made identity more convenient but gave control to a few big tech companies
* Privacy concerns emerged around tracking and data collection by identity providers

### Web3 Identifiers (2010s-Present)

Web3 is ushering in a new phase of digital identity:

* Blockchain technology enables decentralized, user-controlled identity
* Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) give users more control of their data
* Verifiable credentials allow proving claims without oversharing personal info
* Self-sovereign identity (SSI) puts users in charge of their identities
* But standards are still emerging and adoption is in early stages

### The Path Forward

* Digital identity has evolved from limited and decentralized, to convenient but centralized, to user-empowered but complex
* Widespread adoption of SSI is the ideal end state but faces challenges:
  * Technical complexity and lack of standards
  * Entrenched control by big tech identity providers
  * Low awareness and demand by mainstream users
* Continued development of standards and user-friendly SSI solutions will be key
* Regulatory efforts may also help accelerate the shift to user-controlled identity
* While still on the horizon, a future of self-sovereign identity promises greater privacy, security and control for internet users
