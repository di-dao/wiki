## Features

Sonr is a combination of decentralized primitives. Fundamentally, it is a peer-to-peer identity and asset management system that leverages DID documents, Webauthn, and IPFS â€” providing users with a secure, portable decentralized identity.

Sonr is built on top of the Cosmos SDK, which is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang. We have built the above modules to provide a decentralized identity and asset management system.

## Status

- [x] **Alpha**: Closed testing.
- [x] **Private Devnet**: May have kinks. [See projects](https://sonr.io/dashboard).
- [ ] **Public Testnet**: Stable for non-enterprise use. [Join it](https://sonr.io/dashboard).
- [ ] **Mainnet**: Coming soon. [Watch status](https://sonr.io/docs/guides/getting-started/features#feature-status).

We are currently in transitioning to Public Testnet. Watch [releases](https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/releases) of this repo to get notified of major updates.

## Architecture

Sonr is a [blockchain node](https://sonr.io/dashboard) which you can run locally, or use to join our testnet. You can sign up and start using Sonr without installing anything using our [dashboard](https://sonr.io/dashboard).
