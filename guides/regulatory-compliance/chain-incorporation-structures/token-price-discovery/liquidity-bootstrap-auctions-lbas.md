# Liquidity Bootstrap Auctions (LBAs)

LBAs are generally combined with another distribution mechanism such as a lockdrop. Lockdrop participants can commit all or part of their funds into a pool (e.g. paired with a stablecoin). This way other users can buy the tokens from lockdrop participants right away by depositing the stablecoin receiving the price depending on the balance of the pool. When the initial LBA phase is over, the final price of the native token is determined by the ratio of native coins to stablecoins and various auction participants receive (locked and vesting) LP shares pro-rata on their deposits. If there is sufficient participation in the LBA, there will be immediate and deep liquidation at the market price.

* **Adoption Rate:** LBAs have been around since the 2021 bull market but have been used only by very few projects. Notable Cosmos examples include the initial launch of Mars protocol on Terra and Astroport.
* **Timing:** LBAs are usually conducted right before the project launches and are therefore part of the project's launch sequence.
* **Initiator of the Sale:** The LBA may be initiated by the project team itself. The LBP may be initiated by the project team itself or there may be a portion of token set in the genesis file that is dedicated to liquidity bootstrapping. In order to launch the token and conduct the sale/distribution in a more decentralized manner is to initiate the sale via a governance proposal.This will only work however, if tokens have already launched and are already in the hands of users, e.g. via a prior airdrop.
* **Flow of Funds:** Funds generated from an LBA are generally kept in the LP they are raised for, as the LP shares are owned by the users.
* **Who Can Invest:** Technically anyone can invest, but the complexity of the mechanism can be a hurdle for some users. Further, certain projects may impose restrictions based on geographic location or other criteria to comply with local regulations.
* **Decentralization:** Due to little to no restrictions into who can participate, this price discovery mechanism has a high chance of distributing tokens into a variety of users hands, however, this is not necessarily a given as it also depends on the terms of the lockdrop, and how appealing it is to a wide user base. If the LBA is not initiated by the founding team or project and the funds flow into a protocol owned pool this mechanism is relatively decentralized.
