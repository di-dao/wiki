# 4. Distribution of Chain Voting Control

Ensuring an equitable distribution of voting power is essential to avoid concentrated decision-making within the network. Several factors can be considered:

## Initial Token Distribution

The portion of tokens allocated to community-controlled pools, the foundation, investors and team members should be carefully considered and well-balanced to prevent excessive voting power concentration. Even a 10% allocation to a single stakeholder can be considered significant and should be avoided. For example, if a combined allocation to the centrally controlled foundation and team members leads up to more than 50%, it may raise concerns about excessive control by specific parties with aligned interests.

## Validator Delegations

If tokens are delegated in the genesis file, they should be distributed relatively fairly among all validators to further decentralize the voting power. Delegation programs can be implemented at a later stage.Simple approaches, such as providing equal delegations to each validator, or more sophisticated programs like the [**Interchain Foundation's delegation policy**](https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/icf-delegations-policy-a2c3f91e6e), can incentivize positive contributions to the network.

While foundation votes can still override validator votes, a public commitment to refrain from voting and a consistent track record of upholding that commitment can help foster the perception that the founding team was not involved in key network decisions.

## **Enabling Decentralization Through Airdrops**

Airdrops play a crucial role in the Cosmos ecosystem by distributing tokens widely and promoting community engagement. They are a powerful tool to bootstrap new projects and foster active participation in the network. Often overlooked, **airdrops contribute to decentralization by rapidly distributing ownership and voting power among a large number of individuals**.

This democratic allocation of tokens ensures decision-making authority is shared among a large group of stakeholders rather than among a few entities. By utilizing airdrops, projects can establish a diverse and engaged token-holder community from the start, facilitating fair and inclusive governance. This strengthens the principles of decentralization and establishes a solid foundation for effective on-chain decision-making.

## Market Creation & Token Sale

When it comes to token sale and the creation of token markets, it is important to approach these activities with caution and consider common practices to mitigate legal risks.

One way to create a market for the token in a more decentralized manner is by having the founding team or core entity responsible for creating the protocol not directly involved in initiating the sale. As such, none of the founders or entities controlled by the founders receive funds directly. Instead, the protocol itself, such as a community or a network-owned pool, should be the receiving party and the decision to create the market should be made through a community vote by token holders.

This can be achieved through community-initiated market creation via a governance proposal. Anyone holding tokens can submit the proposal, including founders or core team members. In this case, the proposer presents the suggestion but the decision-making process is decentralized, as the community of voters ultimately makes the decision.

Tokens used for market creation can come from the community pool or another decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled pool specifically designated for market creation such as a “liquidity bootstrapping treasury”. Through this approach, no single individual or entity is directly responsible for a token sale or market creation.
