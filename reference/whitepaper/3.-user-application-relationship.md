# 3. User Application Relationship

The User-Application relationship is facilitated through a structured process that defines the user's identity in a secure, verifiable manner, and permits applications to interact with this identity within a decentralized framework. The system employs a novel method for registering and authenticating users, grounded in the principles of blockchain technology.

This system's approach to managing user identity offers several practical advantages. It ensures a high level of security by employing cryptographic authentication, decentralizes the control of identity away from any single authority, and maintains user autonomy over personal information. The transparency in service records enhances trust, while the role of relaying parties streamlines the verification process. Integration with blockchain-based organizational entities extends the user's ability to perform secure and direct interactions within the network.

* **Role of Intermediaries in Network Communication**: Within this ecosystem, intermediary entities, termed relaying parties, are designated to facilitate the communication between client applications and the blockchain. These entities store essential configuration details and support the integrity and efficiency of the identity verification process, thereby enhancing the system's overall reliability.
* **Integration with Organizational Entities**: The system also introduces the integration of organizational entities that exist on the blockchain, creating a synergy between these entities and the user's identity. Linking organizational roles and permissions with DIDs allows for a seamless interaction with smart contracts and other blockchain-based organizational structures, directly with a verified digital identity.
* **Structure and Format of Decentralized Identifiers**: Central to the system's identity management is the use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which serve as a pivotal component for user identification. DIDs are formulated to ensure security, control, and interoperability of the user's identity data across various service landscapes. Stored on a blockchain, these identifiers resist tampering and provide a dependable mechanism for verification processes.
* **Service Records in Identity Management**: Service records constitute a detailed catalog of services linked to a user's DID, delineating the mechanisms through which the user's identity can be authenticated and utilized. These records act as a transparent and secure method for applications to understand and engage with the user's identity, ensuring that the user's interaction with services is based on consent and awareness.
