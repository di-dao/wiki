# 4. Incentivizing Digital Integrity Persistence

The role of tokenomics in the proposed system is twofold: it provides a medium of exchange within the ecosystem and serves as a reward mechanism for validators. The platform's native tokens are used to facilitate transactions, secure network integrity, and incentivize behaviors that contribute to the network's longevity and reliability

Validators play a pivotal role in the network, responsible for processing authentication requests and maintaining the blockchain's integrity. They are incentivized through a task claiming process based on a first-come-first-serve mechanism and are remunerated via transaction fees and token rewards. This incentive structure ensures the high performance and reliability of services within the network.

1. **Task Claiming on a First-Come-First-Serve Basis**: Validators select tasks from the Order Stack on a first-come-first-serve basis, ensuring a fair and efficient distribution of work.
2. **Delivery and Payment Process**: If a validator successfully delivers a service request, they proceed to the payment process. The payment is provided with a vesting schedule, aligning the validators' incentives with the long-term health of the network.
3. **Slashing Conditions for Non-Delivery**: In instances where a validator fails to deliver on a service request, a slashing condition is triggered. This condition serves as a deterrent against poor performance and ensures the reliability of services within the network.
4. **Consequences of Failure**: Failure to deliver a service results in the slashing and burning of the validator's staked SNR tokens. This punitive measure reinforces the commitment of validators to fulfill their tasks diligently and efficiently.
