# ðŸ“„ Whitepaper

The standardization of user identity has historically been inconsistent, leading to reliance on proprietary third-party sources for identity verification. We proposae a peer-to-peer network which addresses this by authenticating identifiers at the device level, thereby bypassing the limitations of centralized identity management systems.&#x20;

This methodological shift not only bolsters the veracity of digital identities but also ensures adherence to the W3C Decentralized Identifiers standards, advocating for a universally recognized framework of digital identity verification.
