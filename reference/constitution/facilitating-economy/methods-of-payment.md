# Methods of Payment

In the Sonr ecosystem, users have various unique opportunities to exchange SNR tokens with validators for access to network services. This article explores the different methods of payment available, highlighting the flexibility and convenience offered by the Sonr network.

### 1. Authenticating with a Service

When a user authenticates with a service through Sonr, the service owner pays the authentication fee to the validator. This fee, typically denominated in SNR tokens, ensures that the user's identity is verified and secure, providing a seamless login experience.

### 2. Opening an Encrypted Channel

To establish a secure communication channel, service owners can pay validators in SNR tokens. This payment enables the creation of an encrypted channel, ensuring that all data exchanged between the user and the service remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access.

### 3. Registering a Service Record

Service owners can register their service on the Sonr network by paying a fee to the treasury in SNR tokens. This registration process creates a service record, which serves as a verified and trusted entry point for users to interact with the service.

### 4. Verifying a Signature

When a service requires signature verification, the service owner can pay a small fee in SNR tokens to the validator. This payment ensures that the signature is authenticated, providing an additional layer of security and trust for the service and its users.

### 5. Sending a Message to a User's Inbox

Service owners can send messages directly to a user's inbox by paying a fee in SNR tokens to the validator. This feature enables targeted communication and notifications, enhancing the user experience and engagement within the Sonr ecosystem.

### 6. Issuing a Credential for a User on a Service

Services can issue verified credentials to users by paying a fee in SNR tokens to the validator. These credentials serve as proof of a user's attributes, qualifications, or achievements, enabling trust and reducing friction in various scenarios, such as job applications or access control.

### 7. Validating a Credential for a User on a Service

When a service needs to validate a user's credential, the service owner can pay a fee in SNR tokens to the validator. This validation process ensures that the credential is authentic and up-to-date, providing assurance to the service and enabling seamless user experiences.

### 8. Looking up User Identifier Existence in Zero-Knowledge Accumulator

Services can check if a user identifier exists in the zero-knowledge accumulator by paying a fee in SNR tokens to the validator. This privacy-preserving lookup enables services to verify the presence of an identifier without revealing any specific details about the user.

### 9. Staking for Elevated Privileges

Users and developers can stake their SNR tokens to unlock elevated privileges within the Sonr network. For example, staking a minimum of 200,000,000 SNR for 30 days allows users to persist a username, while staking 500,000,000 SNR for 12 months grants developers elevated access to create scoped personal access tokens and register service records.

These methods of payment showcase the diverse range of services and functionalities available within the Sonr ecosystem. By leveraging SNR tokens as the primary means of exchange, Sonr creates a seamless and efficient marketplace for users, developers, and service providers to interact and transact securely.

As the Sonr network continues to evolve, we can expect the introduction of even more innovative payment methods and service offerings, further enhancing the utility and value of SNR tokens within the ecosystem.
