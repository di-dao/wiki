# Responsibilities of Validators

As a pioneering force in the blockchain industry, Sonr is committed to maintaining a robust, secure, and efficient network. Central to this mission is our Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, which relies on the crucial role played by validator nodes. In this post, we'll explore the responsibilities of these validators and highlight their significance in the Sonr ecosystem.

### Ensuring Network Security and Integrity

Validators form the backbone of Sonr's DPoS system, tasked with the vital responsibility of verifying transactions and creating new blocks. By participating in the consensus process, validators safeguard the network against malicious activities and maintain the integrity of the blockchain. Their diligence and expertise are essential in preventing double-spending, network attacks, and other security threats.

### Providing Reliable and Efficient Transaction Processing

In addition to security, validators play a key role in ensuring the swift and reliable processing of transactions on the Sonr network. By leveraging their technical infrastructure and resources, validators contribute to the network's high throughput and low latency. This efficiency is crucial for delivering a seamless user experience and enabling the development of powerful decentralized applications.

### Participating in Governance and Decision Making

Validators are not only technical facilitators but also active participants in Sonr's governance process. They have the opportunity to propose and vote on network upgrades, protocol changes, and other critical decisions that shape the future of the platform. This collaborative approach ensures that Sonr remains adaptable, innovative, and aligned with the needs of its community.

### Staking and Rewards: Aligning Incentives

To become a validator on the Sonr network, individuals or entities must stake a significant amount of SNR tokens. This staking mechanism serves as a powerful incentive for validators to act in the best interests of the network. By having skin in the game, validators are motivated to maintain high standards of performance, security, and reliability. In return for their services, validators are rewarded with newly minted SNR tokens, creating a virtuous cycle of participation and value creation.

### Empowering Decentralization and Community Engagement

Sonr's DPoS system not only ensures network security and efficiency but also promotes decentralization and community engagement. By enabling SNR token holders to delegate their stakes to trusted validators, DPoS allows for a more inclusive and participatory ecosystem. This democratic approach encourages active involvement from the community and fosters a sense of shared ownership and responsibility.
