  services in the Sonr network.

# ‚ùî ADR-003: Service Records

## O**bjective**

* Alleviate decentralized organization management with on-chain implementation
* Enforce Compliance with WebAuthn Relaying Party Specification for consistency
* Enable Domain Origin support with DNS TXT Record Verification

***

## Sequence Methods

#### 1. Creating a Sonr Developer Account

The Blockchain creates an on-chain multisig using the `x/group` module and sets the delegator as the owner.

* During Testnet; this is alleviated by requests to the Faucet airdrop
* Stake **$SNR 500** to unlock elevated developer permissions (i.e. Creating scoped Personal Access Tokens, Registering Service Records, etc.)

#### 2. Configuring a Service

Upon successful authentication a New record of the event is stored on chain with an encrypted fingerprint and the account which was authenticated.

* Permission scope for app determined by utilized Network features
* Validator initializes record with parameters for functioning as a Relaying party and the minimum user identifier requirements

#### 3. On-Chain Authorization Sequence

| Authenticating with a Service                                  | Service Owner | Validator |
| Open an encrypted channel                                      | Service Owner | Validator |
| Register a service record                                      | Service Owner | Treasury  |
| Verify a Signature                                             | Service Owner | Validator |

| Validate a Credential for the User on a Service                | Service Owner | Validator |
| Lookup User Identifier existence in Zero-knowledge Accumulator | Service Owner | Validator |

### Staking Incentives

| Action                   | Minimum Delegation | Unlock Period |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------- |
| Persisting a Username    | USNR 200,000,000   | 30 Days       |
| Elevate Developer Access | USNR 500,000,000   | 12 Months     |
