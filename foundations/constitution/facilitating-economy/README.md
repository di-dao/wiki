# Facilitating Economy

Sonr is building a robust and dynamic token economy that facilitates the exchange of value, incentivizes participation, and drives the growth of its decentralized identity and data management ecosystem. At the heart of this economy is the SNR token, which serves multiple critical functions. Let's explore the key aspects of Sonr's token ecosystem.

### Genesis Allocation

The genesis allocation of SNR tokens is an important factor in establishing a fair and balanced distribution among key stakeholders. The allocation is divided into segments such as the P1 Round, P2 Round, Community, and Team. Each segment has a specific allocation percentage, ensuring a diverse distribution of tokens.

### Stakeholder Vesting Schedule

To align the long-term interests of stakeholders with the success of the Sonr network, a vesting schedule is implemented. The vesting schedule determines when and how allocated tokens become available to stakeholders over time. This mechanism helps to promote long-term commitment and reduces the risk of sudden token dumps that could negatively impact the market.

### Hands of Trade

The exchange of SNR tokens within the Sonr network involves various stakeholders, each playing a unique role in the ecosystem:

* **Validators and Stakers**: Validators stake SNR tokens to participate in the network's consensus process and are rewarded for their contributions. Stakers delegate their SNR tokens to validators, strengthening the network's security and earning a portion of the rewards.
* **Developers and End Users**: Developers integrate Sonr's technology into their applications, enabling end users to access services using SNR tokens. The exchange of SNR between developers and end users drives innovation and growth within the ecosystem.
* **Token Holders and the Sonr Foundation**: Token holders support the growth and stability of the ecosystem by providing liquidity and participating in governance. The Sonr Foundation oversees the development and promotion of the ecosystem, using mechanisms like grants and subsidies to incentivize participation.
* **Enterprises and Partnerships**: Enterprises and partnerships expand the use cases of the Sonr network and drive the adoption of the SNR token by integrating Sonr's technology into their systems and processes.

### Methods of Payment

SNR tokens serve as the primary means of payment for various network services provided by validators. Some of these services include:

* Authenticating with a service
* Opening an encrypted channel
* Registering a service record
* Verifying a signature
* Sending a message to a user's inbox
* Issuing and validating credentials for users on a service
* Looking up user identifier existence in the zero-knowledge accumulator

Users and developers can also stake SNR tokens to unlock elevated privileges within the network, such as persisting a username or gaining access to create scoped personal access tokens and register service records.

### Responsibilities of Validators

Validators play a critical role in Sonr's Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. They are responsible for ensuring network security, providing reliable transaction processing, participating in governance, and staking SNR tokens. Validators are incentivized through rewards in the form of newly minted SNR tokens, creating a virtuous cycle of participation and value creation.

### Token Value Generation

The value of the SNR token is driven by multiple factors within the Sonr ecosystem:

* **Securing the Network through Staking**: As more validators join and stake SNR tokens, the overall security of the network increases, attracting more users and developers.
* **Powering Verification Services**: The demand for Sonr's identity verification services directly impacts the value of the SNR token, as these services are paid for using SNR.
* **Enabling Interchain Security and Interoperability**: SNR tokens facilitate seamless interaction and asset transfer between different blockchain networks, increasing their demand as more projects adopt Sonr's identity solution.
* **Incentivizing Participation and Ecosystem Growth**: SNR tokens incentivize developers to build applications and users to actively participate in the network, fostering a vibrant and engaged community.
* **Governance and Decision-Making**: SNR token holders can participate in the governance of the Sonr network by staking their tokens and voting on important decisions, ensuring the network remains aligned with the interests of its stakeholders.

### Conclusion

Sonr's token ecosystem is designed to facilitate a thriving economy that drives the adoption and growth of its decentralized identity and data management solutions. By carefully designing the token allocation, vesting schedule, and utility functions, Sonr creates a sustainable and vibrant ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders.

As the Sonr network continues to evolve and attract more users, developers, and partners, the value of the SNR token is poised to grow, supported by its multiple use cases and the increasing demand for secure, decentralized identity solutions.
