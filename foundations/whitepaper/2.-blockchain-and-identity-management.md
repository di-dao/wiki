# 2. Blockchain & Identity Management

In a world with Quantum Computing Resisting cryptographic methods there isn't a need to bear so much of the responsibility regarding authentication in the hands of the user. Sonr was designed to simplify the user experience while simultaneously providing far greater security measures over their personal data. We incorporate the following concepts in our Identity primitive:

* **Multi-Party Computation:** We remove the usage of a Private Keys when constructing Digital signatures by utilizing Rotating Keyshares with the DKLS algorithm.
* **Identifier Accumulators:** Accounts are structured to be Anonymous and Private by default. Sonr Employs a Zero-knowledge Accumulator to achieve this result with sub-identifiers.
* **Wallet Interface:** The public key of the Sonr Account is encoded with `bech32` and persisted on-chain. Accounts are persisted across all Validator nodes providing a resilient and highly resolvable digital profile.

When incorporating all these concepts in tandem we achieve a portable, interoperable, and secure Identifier that we define as a _Sonr Account_.

The Sonr platform approaches user authentication with the recognition that a user's identity is multi-dimensional and must be safeguarded with the utmost integrity. This is achieved through the implementation of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC), creating a robust framework for identity management. DIDs are a cornerstone of the Sonr identity system, providing a verifiable and self-sovereign identity that users control entirely.
