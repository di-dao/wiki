# USDnr High-Level Architecture

## Components

1. **Service Records**: Each record will have an additional field to track stablecoin balance and transactions associated with that service. Also, include permissions for stablecoin operations.
2. **Payment Handler API**: Your existing Service Worker will incorporate the Payment Handler API to manage stablecoin transactions. This will be the entry point for initiating payments, both for minting and transferring stablecoins.
3. **Universal Stablecoin Module**: Extend `x/service` to include a stablecoin issuance and management functionality. This module interacts with Service Records and handles stablecoin logic.

## Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - User initializes a transaction on an app that's registered with Sonr.
   - Payment Handler API kicks in, using the Service Worker to intercept the transaction.
2. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - User gets authenticated via WebAuthn.
   - Service Record is queried to check if the user has the necessary permissions for a stablecoin operation.
3. **Transaction Handling**:
   - Payment Handler API constructs a stablecoin transaction (mint, transfer, etc.).
   - Transaction is sent to the Universal Stablecoin Module in `x/service`.
4. **State Update & Validation**:
   - `x/service` validates the transaction against the Service Record.
   - If valid, the stablecoin balance in the Service Record is updated.
5. **Completion**:
   - Payment Handler API receives a transaction receipt.
   - The user is notified, and the Service Worker updates the app's frontend accordingly.
6. **Record-keeping**:
   - All stablecoin transactions are logged in the Service Record for audit and analytics.
7. **IBC Handling** (Optional):
   - If the stablecoin needs to be sent to another chain, IBC packets get constructed and sent.
8. **Monitoring & Auditing**:
   - Metrics are sent to a monitoring service for real-time tracking.
   - Periodic audits to ensure security and compliance.

By using the Payment Handler API, you can create a seamless user experience that abstracts away the complexity of blockchain transactions. This approach also enables you to tap into existing web payment ecosystems, potentially driving faster adoption.

## Launch Strategy

To issue a stablecoin that serves as a decentralized, secure, and efficient medium of exchange within the Sonr ecosystem, enhancing user experience and driving platform adoption.

#### Initiatives

1. **Universal Stablecoin Module**: A core extension to `x/service` that handles minting, transferring, and burning of stablecoins.
2. **Service Records**: Enhanced to store stablecoin balances and transaction history.
3. **Payment Handler API**: Integrated into Service Worker for seamless UX and transaction management.

#### Phases

1. **Development & Testing**
   - Extend `x/service` to add the stablecoin module.
   - Update Service Records schema.
   - Integrate Payment Handler API.
2. **Security Audit**
   - Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify vulnerabilities.
   - Address any issues found to ensure robustness.
3. **Private Sale (Testnet)**
   - Invite-only sale to a select group of early adopters.
   - Gauge the system's performance and iron out any issues.
4. **Public Launch**
   - Full-scale launch of the stablecoin.
   - Roll out to all users and apps within the Sonr ecosystem.
5. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Real-time tracking of transactions, usage, and performance.
   - Periodic audits for security and compliance.
6. **Partnerships & Ecosystem Growth**
   - Integrate with other platforms and services via IBC or other interoperability protocols.
   - Incentive programs for developers to integrate the stablecoin into their services.

#### Key Metrics

1. **Transaction Volume**: A measure of adoption and utility.
2. **User Engagement**: Number of active wallets, transaction frequency.
3. **Security Incidents**: Tracking of any security issues, successful or otherwise.
4. **Performance Metrics**: Latency, throughput, and other system performance indicators.

#### Risks & Mitigations

1. **Regulatory Risk**: Consult with legal advisors for compliance.
2. **Security Risk**: Regular audits and monitoring.
3. **Adoption Risk**: Incentive programs and partnerships to drive usage.

By implementing this strategy, Sonr aims to create a stablecoin that not only adds value to its ecosystem but also serves as a benchmark for decentralized financial transactions.
