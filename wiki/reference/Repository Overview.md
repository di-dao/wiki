# Repository Study Guide



The sonr repository contains the core blockchain functionality and components for building the Sonr decentralized identity network. At a high level, it provides application logic like configuration and initialization, a CLI, networking components, scripts for nodes, common utilities, blockchain integrations, core packages, and frontend assets.

Some of the most important functionality includes:

* The application logic defined in`[app](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app>)`and`[…/params](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/params>)`handles critical configuration and initialization when running a Sonr node. The`[…/app.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/app.go>)`file builds the application instance through dependency injection and service registration.

* The CLI and business logic in`[…/sonrd](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd>)`implements the command line interface and networking components. The`[…/cmd](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/cmd>)`subdirectory defines the command handler structure using Cobra.`[…/main.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/main.go>)`serves as the entry point, initializing settings and executing the root command handler. Additional networking and protocol logic is implemented in imported Go packages.

* Scripts like`[…/entrypoint.sh](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/scripts/entrypoint.sh>)`and`[…/setup-dev.sh](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/scripts/setup-dev.sh>)`handle installing dependencies, generating keys, configuring services, and starting Sonr nodes. This provides the necessary functionality for initializing and running nodes.

* Components in`[build](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build>)`integrate Sonr with external blockchains for indexing events and building connected applications. For example,`[…/networks](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks>)`retrieves events from different chains, while`[…/rails](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/rails>)`sets up a Rails app with an IPFS node on Kubernetes.

* Packages in`[pkg](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg>)`implement core utilities like DID and session management middleware that provide reusable components. The`[…/crypto](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/common/crypto>)`subdirectory also contains common crypto utilities.

* Frontend assets in`[static](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/static>)`include JavaScript to integrate UI libraries and make requests.

The crypto subdirectory implements extensive support for signatures, threshold schemes, zero-knowledge proofs, secret sharing, distributed key generation, and more. These provide the algorithms that enable privacy-preserving decentralized identity transactions.

The modular structure separates concerns into logical components and packages focused on specific functionality like networking, CLI handling, scripts, and crypto schemes. Together these components comprise a full-stack decentralized identity platform.

## Application Logic

References:`[app](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app>)`,`[app/params](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/params>)`

The`[app](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app>)`directory contains the core application logic for initializing, configuring, and running the Sonr blockchain. It handles the key tasks of dependency injection, configuration, and building the final application instance.

The`[…/params](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/params>)`subdirectory centralizes important configuration parameters and encoding specifications. The`[…/config.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/params/config.go>)`file defines constants and functions for configuring SDK parameters such as the coin denomination and Bech32 address prefixes. On initialization, it registers the supported coin denomination with the SDK and sets the Bech32 prefixes and address verifier. The`[…/encoding.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/params/encoding.go>)`file defines a struct that specifies the concrete encoding types to use, containing an interface for custom types, a codec, transaction encoding config, and optional legacy codec. This struct centralizes the different encoding configurations into a single structure.

The core of the application logic is defined in`[…/app.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/app.go>)`. This file defines a struct that holds the application state. The key functionality includes dependency injection and initialization. The initialization performs dependency injection, builds the underlying application, and registers services. Other important methods include functions for the encoding and simulation components.

### **Configuration**

References:`[app/params](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/params>)`

This section handles critical configuration parameters and encodings for the Sonr application. The`[…/params](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/params>)`directory centralizes important configuration parameters and encoding specifications into standardized structures.

The file`[…/config.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/params/config.go>)`defines constants and functions for configuring SDK parameters such as the coin denomination, default bond denomination, and Bech32 address prefixes. On initialization, it registers the coin denomination with the SDK and sets the Bech32 prefixes and address verifier.

The file`[…/encoding.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/params/encoding.go>)`defines a struct that specifies the concrete encoding types. The struct contains an interface for registering custom types, a codec for encoding and decoding data, a config for transaction encoding configuration, and an optional codec for legacy support. By collecting all the encoding pieces into the struct, it allows different encoding backends like Protobuf or Amino to be easily interchanged. The application code only needs to interact with the struct instead of individual encoding parts

### **Initialization**

References:`[app/app.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/app.go>)`

The`[…/app.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/app.go>)`file contains the core logic for building and configuring the Sonr application instance. It defines a struct that holds the application state.

The struct has fields for dependencies. The function handles instantiating these dependencies and building the final instance. It takes a parameter to allow configuring dependencies during initialization through a function.

After building dependencies, initializes the using a method. This method:

* Sets the encoding through a function

* Initializes the at the given database backend

* Mounts API routes by calling a function

The can then be used by calling methods to access the underlying component. Other important methods include a method for generating files and a method for versioning.

The dependency injection function allows configuring core components before initialization. This follows an dependency injection pattern to decouple configuration from the struct definition.

### **Export**

References:`[app/export.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/app/export.go>)`

The export functionality handles exporting the application state for genesis or migrations. It exports the state at a given height by creating a new context at the next height. It then calls a function to serialize the genesis state to JSON.

It also exports validators by calling a function. This function handles writing the validators to the exported data. The exported data, validators, height, and consensus params are then returned.

When preparing the state for export at height 0, it first handles distributions by withdrawing rewards.

It also resets heights and counters in staking data by iterating through validators and resetting their heights using a keeper. If exporting for a whitelist, it also jails non-whitelisted validators.

### **Signatures**

References:`[crypto/signatures](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/signatures>)`

The`[…/bls](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/signatures/bls>)`directory implements BLS signatures according to the BLS12-381 elliptic curve specification. The main functionality is provided by the`[…/bls_sig](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/signatures/bls/bls_sig>)`package.

The`[…/ted25519](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/ted25519>)`directory implements threshold and distributed signature schemes based on the Ed25519 signature algorithm. It contains two important subdirectories that provide threshold signing functionality:

`[…/frost](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/ted25519/frost>)`implements threshold signatures using the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures) protocol. FROST allows for t-of-n threshold signing where t out of n participants are needed to generate a signature. This provides resilience against up to t-1 malicious or offline participants. The protocol is implemented over three rounds.

In the first round, the functions in`[…/round1.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/ted25519/frost/round1.go>)`sample random scalars and compute the corresponding points that are returned.

In the second round, the functions in`[…/round2.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/ted25519/frost/round2.go>)`aggregate the commitments from round 1, derive the challenge from the message and commitments, and compute the response scalar.

The third round functions in`[…/round3.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/ted25519/frost/round3.go>)`generate the final signature from the partial signatures produced in the first two rounds.

`[…/ted25519](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/ted25519/ted25519>)`implements the core Ed25519 signature generation, verification, and key generation functionality needed to support the FROST protocol. This includes generating signature shares in`[…/partialsig.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/ted25519/ted25519/partialsig.go>)`and securely aggregating signatures in`[…/sigagg.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/ted25519/ted25519/sigagg.go>)`.

Unit tests for FROST are defined in`[…/rounds_test.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/ted25519/frost/rounds_test.go>)`to validate the protocol implementation. Tests initialize instances and run the full protocol between them.

### **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**

References:`[crypto/zkp](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/zkp>)`,`[crypto/bulletproof](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/bulletproof>)`

The`[…/zkp](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/zkp>)`directory implements several important zero-knowledge proof systems. Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party (the prover) to prove to another (the verifier) that they know some value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know x. This has applications in privacy-preserving blockchain technologies.

The primary zero-knowledge proof scheme implemented is the Schnorr proof system in the`[…/schnorr](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/zkp/schnorr>)`subdirectory. The core Schnorr zero-knowledge proof logic is implemented in the`[…/schnorr.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/zkp/schnorr/schnorr.go>)`file, which defines a struct that can generate Schnorr proofs for a given elliptic curve point. This functionality is tested in the`[…/schnorr_test.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/zkp/schnorr/schnorr_test.go>)`file by generating and verifying proofs for random secrets on multiple elliptic curves from the`[…/curves](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/core/curves>)`package.

The`[…/bulletproof](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/bulletproof>)`directory implements the Bulletproofs protocol. Bulletproofs allow for efficient zero-knowledge range proofs and inner product proofs on confidential data. The main functionality includes generation and verification of Inner Product Proofs using the`[…/ipp_prover.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/bulletproof/ipp_prover.go>)`and`[…/ipp_verifier.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/bulletproof/ipp_verifier.go>)`files. Generation and verification of batched range proofs uses the`[…/range_batch_prover.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/bulletproof/range_batch_prover.go>)`and`[…/range_batch_verifier.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/bulletproof/range_batch_verifier.go>)`files. Helper functions implementing the necessary linear algebra are provided in`[…/helpers.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/bulletproof/helpers.go>)`.

### **Secret Sharing**

References:`[crypto/sharing](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/sharing>)`

The`[…/sharing](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/sharing>)`package provides implementations of secret sharing schemes using elliptic curves. Secret sharing allows a secret to be split into multiple shares in such a way that some threshold of shares is required to reconstruct the secret, but fewer shares reveal no information about the secret.

The main secret sharing schemes implemented are Shamir's secret sharing and Feldman verifiable secret sharing (VSS). Different elliptic curves are supported for representing the secret shares, including BLS12-381 G1/G2, Ed25519, K256, and P-256.

Core functionality includes splitting secrets into shares, combining shares back into secrets, and verifying individual shares. Shares are encoded as points on the underlying elliptic curves. Random polynomials are used to generate shares in the Shamir scheme, while the Feldman scheme deterministically maps secrets to shares. Lagrange interpolation is used for combining shares in the Shamir and Feldman schemes.

The struct in`[…/shamir.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/sharing/shamir.go>)`encapsulates a Shamir secret sharing configuration.

Underlying elliptic curve functionality is implemented in files like`[…/bls12381g1curve.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/sharing/v1/bls12381g1curve.go>)`. This handles critical primitives like point addition and scalar multiplication used throughout.

Thorough unit testing of the schemes is done in files like`[…/bls12381g1_feldman_test.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/sharing/v1/bls12381g1_feldman_test.go>)`. The tests cover all combinations of shares, error cases, and ensure secrets can be correctly reconstructed.

### **Distributed Key Generation**

References:`[crypto/dkg](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/dkg>)`

The`[…/dkg](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/dkg>)`package implements distributed key generation protocols. DKG allows a group of participants to jointly generate a public/private key pair in a distributed manner.

The package contains implementations of two main DKG protocols. The`[…/gennaro](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/dkg/gennaro>)`subdirectory implements an adapted version of the protocol from the paper "Secure and Efficient Cooperative Key Agreement" by Gennaro et al. It allows a group to jointly generate a key pair for use in threshold signatures.

The`[…/frost](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/dkg/frost>)`subdirectory implements the DKG protocol used in the FROST threshold Schnorr signature scheme draft RFC. FROST allows distributed generation of a key pair for threshold Schnorr signatures such that any t+1 of n participants can generate a signature.

Both implementations follow the round-based approach described in their respective references. Key functionality includes secret sharing to split the private key among participants, generation and verification of commitments to reconstruct the public key, and distribution of key shares such that threshold participants can later combine shares to sign or decrypt.

The`[…/gennaro](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/dkg/gennaro>)`implementation models each participant as a struct defined in`[…/participant.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/dkg/gennaro/participant.go>)`. This struct contains the state needed for a participant, such as their ID, current round number, local secret share, shares from other participants, and references to underlying secret sharing schemes. Functions implement the logic for each round of the protocol by manipulating objects.

The`[…/frost](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/dkg/frost>)`implementation similarly defines a struct in`[…/participant.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/dkg/frost/participant.go>)`to track per-participant state. Functions implement the first two rounds of the FROST DKG protocol. They generate and verify commitments and shares by interacting with the struct and underlying cryptographic primitives like the Feldman secret sharing scheme.

### **Oblivious Transfer**

### **Cryptographic Accumulators**

References:`[crypto/accumulator](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/accumulator>)`

The`[…/accumulator](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/accumulator>)`package implements cryptographic accumulator constructions. Cryptographic accumulators allow one to add elements to an accumulator structure and later prove membership of an element without revealing any other elements.

The core data structures used are represented in the`[…/accumulator.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/accumulator/accumulator.go>)`file. It supports efficient addition and removal of elements. It also allows proving membership of elements via which returns coefficients.

Internally, the accumulator stores elements cryptographically to preserve privacy. Polynomial arithmetic functions in`[…/lib.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/accumulator/lib.go>)`are used to efficiently compute the core difference-of-averages construction.

Zero-knowledge proofs are enabled via the coefficients. The struct contains the values needed for the verification algorithm. The struct represents a witness for an element's membership.

The struct in`[…/key.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/accumulator/key.go>)`represents the secret key and implements cryptographic operations like multiplication needed for the accumulator scheme. The method efficiently handles addition or removal of multiple elements.

Thorough unit tests in files like`[…/accumulator_test.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/accumulator/accumulator_test.go>)`and`[…/witness_test.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/accumulator/witness_test.go>)`validate the accumulator, witness, proof, and key functionality.

### **Homomorphic Encryption**

References:`[crypto/paillier](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/paillier>)`

The`[…/paillier](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/paillier>)`directory implements homomorphic encryption using the Paillier cryptosystem. It provides an asymmetric encryption scheme that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data.

Encryption is done with a function, which blinds the message. Decryption is the reverse using a function.

Importantly, the cryptosystem is homomorphic. A function simply multiplies two encrypted ciphertexts to homomorphically add encrypted values. Another function allows multiplication on encrypted data. This enables computation on encrypted data without decrypting intermediate results.

Thorough unit tests of the implementation are provided in`[…/paillier_test.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/paillier/paillier_test.go>)`, covering key generation, encryption/decryption round trips, and verification of homomorphic properties. Additional tests validate helper functions, serialization, and error conditions.

Proofs for the Paillier Function Secret Sharing scheme are implemented in`[…/psf.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/paillier/psf.go>)`and tested in`[…/psf_test.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/paillier/psf_test.go>)`. This provides a way to prove a Paillier public key was generated correctly.

### **Internal Utilities**

References:`[crypto/internal](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/crypto/internal>)`

## Command Line Interface

References:`[cmd/sonrd](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd>)`,`[cmd/sonrd/cmd](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/cmd>)`

The`[…/sonrd](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd>)`package implements the core command line interface and business logic for the sonrd daemon. At the root is the`[…/main.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/main.go>)`file, which serves as the entry point.

Subcommands are defined to expose common operations over CLI.

In summary, the`[…/sonrd](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd>)`package provides a clean separation of CLI handling and core node functionality. It follows best practices and uses the Cobra framework to easily expose an extensible CLI interface.

### **Command Handler**

References:`[cmd/sonrd/cmd](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/cmd>)`,`[cmd/sonrd/cmd/root.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/cmd/root.go>)`

The`[…/cmd](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/cmd>)`package defines the command line interface for the sonrd daemon. It handles registering and dispatching commands to subcommands. The main entry point is defined in`[…/root.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/cmd/root.go>)`, which sets up the top-level command structure and subcommand registration.

When the program starts, the root command is responsible for dependency injection and creating the core application instance. Subcommands are registered by calling a function to add commands, passing a command instance. Some key subcommands include functions to start the daemon and handle networking/consensus logic, manage keys, and print version information.

The individual subcommand implementations live in separate files under`[…/cmd](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/cmd>)`such as for starting the daemon. They focus on the business logic and callbacks for that subcommand.

### **Configuration**

References:`[cmd/sonrd/main.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/main.go>)`

The`[…/main.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/main.go>)`file handles configuration, dependencies, and initialization for the sonrd daemon. At startup, it sets global variables to identify the release. It then initializes address prefixes for the node's services.

The main function creates the root command handler for the CLI. This command handler is responsible for executing subcommands and options. Main also initializes the node's home directory and handles any errors from running the root command.

Some important details:

* A function populates variables used throughout the codebase. This ensures uniform version information.

* Address prefixes are initialized with a function to standardize how addresses for services like p2p and RPC are constructed.

* The root command handler defines flags and subcommands for the daemon. It returns a command that serves as the main entry point.

* When run, the command validates configurations and arguments before executing the appropriate subcommand. Any errors are output.

### **Networking**

References:`[sonr](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/>)`

The`[…/main.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/main.go>)`file serves as the entry point. It initializes settings and executes the root command handler defined in`[…/cmd](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/cmd>)`.

The bulk of the business logic is implemented in packages imported by`[…/main.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/cmd/sonrd/main.go>)`. This includes entities that implement the Sonr protocol and entities that model the local node.

Methods handle listening for and responding to network requests. Packages rely on encoding and decoding messages.

Configuration and dependency injection is handled by structures passed to functions. For example, initializing server and client components by passing the loaded config.

The code makes heavy use of Cobra to handle CLI actions and flags. It relies on the modular package structure to separate concerns into logical packages focused on areas like the CLI, configuration, networking, and the core protocol.

This implements the sonrd daemon functionality in a clean, modular way with clear separation of concerns. The summaries provide context on all important subdirectories and functionality.

## Scripts

The`[…/entrypoint.sh](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/scripts/entrypoint.sh>)`script sets up a Sonr node from scratch by generating keys, initializing the chain, and starting the node process. It first generates a private key for the node account using the provided mnemonic, storing it. It then initializes the node, specifying the moniker, chain ID, and home directory.

Next, it adds a genesis account to the genesis state file, allocating coins to the new key. A genesis transaction is also generated for the key. All genesis transactions are collected together. The generated genesis file is validated.

Finally, the script starts the process, configuring parameters like the log level, pruning, unsafe RPC, and minimum gas prices. This provides a complete setup of a Sonr node that can join the network on startup.

The entrypoint script handles the following key functionality:

* It uses the command to generate a private key for the node account from the provided mnemonic, storing it.

* The command initializes the node, specifying the moniker, chain ID, and home directory. This sets up the necessary directories and configuration.

* The command adds a genesis account to the genesis state file, allocating coins to the new key.

* A genesis transaction is generated for the key.

* All genesis transactions are collected together into the genesis file.

* The generated genesis file is validated.

* Finally, is started as a daemon, configured with parameters like log level and minimum gas prices.

### **Dependency Management**

References:`[scripts/install-deps.sh](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/scripts/install-deps.sh>)`

It contains functions to install packages on different operating systems in a consistent way. The functions provide a simple and consistent API for the Sonr scripts to install all needed build dependencies. By abstracting the package installation behind platform-agnostic functions, this ensures dependencies can be installed consistently regardless of the operating system. It also makes it easy to add support for new platforms by implementing additional installer functions as needed.

### **Installation**

It handles package management for Linux and macOS by utilizing functions for installing dependencies from remote scripts or downloading artifacts from GitHub releases.

The main logic installs Sonr by downloading necessary binaries and configuration files from release artifacts. It presents the user with an interactive menu to manage Sonr installation and components.

The script ensures Sonr is always up to date by checking for new releases and upgrading components when needed.

### **Development Environment**

References:`[scripts/setup-dev.sh](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/scripts/setup-dev.sh>)`

## Building Blockchains

References:`[build](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build>)`

The`[build](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build>)`directory contains code for building integrations with various blockchain networks and components. This includes modular and reusable code for interfacing with different blockchains in`[…/networks](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks>)`, building Rails applications that utilize IPFS in`[…/rails](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/rails>)`, and other potential integrations.

The`[…/networks](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks>)`subdirectory handles integrating with different blockchains. It contains code for the CometBFT testnet-1 blockchain integration in`[…/testnet-1](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1>)`. This code is responsible for retrieving events from the testnet-1 node and storing them in a PostgreSQL database for querying. It uses the`[…/indexer](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1/etc/indexer>)`subdirectory to define the database schema and store/index the events. The schema file`[…/schema.sql](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1/etc/indexer/schema.sql>)`defines tables for blocks, transactions, events, and event attributes, and creates views to simplify querying.

The`[…/rails](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/rails>)`subdirectory contains reusable components for building Rails applications that utilize IPFS. It includes configuration to deploy an IPFS node on Kubernetes in`[…/kubo](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/rails/kubo>)`using the`[…/config.sh](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/rails/kubo/config.sh>)`script. This script passes a JSON string to the IPFS node to configure gateway settings like HTTP headers, URL prefixes, and public gateways. The Gemfile and Gemfile.lock define dependencies for Rails applications built with these components.

### **Blockchain Integrations**

References:`[build](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build>)`,`[build/networks](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks>)`

The`[…/networks](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks>)`directory contains code for integrating with different blockchains. It provides modular and reusable components for retrieving events from blockchains and storing/indexing the data in a PostgreSQL database.

The main components are:

* The`[…/testnet-1](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1>)`subdirectory, which contains code specific to interacting with the CometBFT testnet-1 blockchain.

* The`[…/etc](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1/etc>)`directory stores configuration for indexing events on testnet-1.

* The`[…/indexer](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1/etc/indexer>)`subdirectory contains the main code for storing blockchain data in the database.

* The database schema is defined programmatically.

* The`[…/indexer](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1/etc/indexer>)`code retrieves events from testnet-1 and inserts them into the defined database tables. Foreign keys link related data for easy joins.

This modular structure separates the blockchain integration logic from the data storage components. New blockchains can easily be supported by adding additional subdirectories similar to`[…/testnet-1](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1>)`. The database schema and storage logic remain unchanged.

### **Indexing Events**

References:`[build/networks/testnet-1](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1>)`,`[build/networks/testnet-1/etc](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1/etc>)`,`[build/networks/testnet-1/etc/indexer](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1/etc/indexer>)`

The`[…/indexer](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1/etc/indexer>)`directory contains code for indexing events on the CometBFT testnet-1 blockchain. The main purpose is to store and index events from the blockchain in a PostgreSQL database for efficient querying.

The`[…/schema.sql](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/networks/testnet-1/etc/indexer/schema.sql>)`file defines the database schema, including tables to store block metadata, transaction results, events, and event attributes. Tables are created to store:

* Block metadata

* Transaction result metadata

* Each event

* Event attributes

Views are created to:

* Join events and attributes

* Filter for block events

* Filter for transaction events

The tables store important data fields referenced in the event data like the block height, chain ID, transaction hash, and event type. Primary keys and indexes are added on critical fields to support efficient querying. Foreign keys link related data between tables.

A class provides the main interface for interacting with the database. Its method handles parsing raw events and storing them in the database tables, while another method retrieves stored events.

### **Building Applications**

References:`[build/rails](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/rails>)`,`[build/rails/kubo](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/rails/kubo>)`

The main functionality is in the`[…/kubo](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/rails/kubo>)`subdirectory. This directory contains code to deploy and manage an IPFS node as a managed service within a Kubernetes cluster. The script`[…/config.sh](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/rails/kubo/config.sh>)`configures the IPFS gateway settings by passing a JSON string to the node. This JSON configures headers, prefixes, and gateways for the IPFS integration. It allows customizing the node configuration for each application's needs.

By running the IPFS node within Kubernetes, the applications built with`[…/rails](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/build/rails>)`can take advantage of IPFS as a managed service. Developers can reuse these components to build blockchain-connected web applications hosted alongside an IPFS node on Kubernetes.

References:`[pkg/env](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/env>)`

The`[…/env](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/env>)`package provides functionality for accessing and managing SONR environment variables and configuration paths in a centralized and consistent manner. At the core is the file`[…/env.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/env/env.go>)`, which exports functionality for interacting with environment settings.

Values can be loaded from environment variables or the filesystem. Once initialized it presents an interface for securely accessing settings without worrying about where the values are stored.

The file's methods handle loading values, with support for JSON, YAML, TOML and other formats. Values can be loaded from files or directly from strings. Priority is given to environment variables over file values, allowing configuration via environment or files. It takes care of ensuring only valid values are accessible via type assertions and defaulting.

### **File Utilities**

References:`[pkg/tarball](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/tarball>)`,`[pkg/xfilepath](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/xfilepath>)`

The`[…/tarball](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/tarball>)`package contains functionality for extracting individual files from gzipped tarball (.tar.gz) files without fully unpacking the archive into memory.

The main logic is contained in the`[…/tarball.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/tarball/tarball.go>)`file. This file defines functions for extracting files. Given a reader pointing to a gzipped tarball, a writer, and a filename, it will validate the filename and check if the file is present in the archive. If so, it copies the file contents to the output writer.

The`[…/xfilepath](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/xfilepath>)`package provides functions for operating on file paths while handling errors. It introduces an interface for retrieving a path along with any error.

The main functions include extracting paths, joining multiple retrievers into one, collecting results into a list, and ensuring a directory exists before returning its path.

Unit tests in`[…/xfilepath_test.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/xfilepath/xfilepath_test.go>)`exercise the functions under different scenarios, validating behavior and error cases. Tests use interfaces and assertions to validate implementations.

### **Sessions**

References:`[pkg/session](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/session>)`

The`[…/session](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/session>)`package provides HTTP session management functionality for Sonr. It implements a middleware that can attach and manage session IDs for HTTP requests.

The core component is the struct defined in the`[…/session.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/session/session.go>)`file. This represents the session middleware and contains the underlying HTTP handler and configuration flags. A function initializes a new instance, allowing options to be set.

The main handler logic is implemented in a method on the struct. This method first retrieves the session ID from the request cookie if present using a function. If no session ID exists, it generates a new one and sets a cookie using a function. It then calls the underlying HTTP handler.

The session middleware provides a simple but complete solution for attaching and managing session IDs in Sonr using HTTP cookies. The struct centralizes the handler and configuration, while the method implements the core checking and setting of session IDs on each request.

### **Data Formats**

The`[…/ipfds](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/ipfds>)`directory allows pinning files to IPFS by their Content Identifier (CID). The`[…/ipfds.go](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/pkg/ipfds/ipfds.go>)`file defines a function that connects to the local IPFS node, parses a CID string, and calls the pinning API to pin the referenced file. This provides a simple wrapper function to pin files by CID with one call.

The`[static](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/static>)`directory contains the static assets for the Sonr frontend application. JavaScript files in`[…/js](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/static/js>)`define the core functionality and integrate various libraries.

The`[…/htmx.ext.shoelace.js](<https://github.com/sonrhq/sonr/blob/6f7bbc0dd7553ecc65b2fdc8b1802fdb8320ca92/static/js/htmx.ext.shoelace.js>)`file plays a key role in enabling dynamic requests by integrating the Shoelace UI component library with HTMX. It defines constants for includable Shoelace element types like ratings and switches. For these element types, it will serialize the value using different attributes instead of the element itself.

When a HTMX event occurs on a form element, it queries for matching Shoelace elements. For ratings, it reads the value from one attribute, while for checkboxes and switches it reads from another attribute. These element values are then added to the HTMX request.

The file also defines an extension to hook this serialization behavior into HTMX's processing. This allows dynamic requests to properly include the values of Shoelace elements.
