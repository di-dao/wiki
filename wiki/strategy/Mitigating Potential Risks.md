# Mitigating Potential Risks

# What Are Our Constraints?

* Maintain a user-friendly experience while ensuring security and privacy, balancing the needs of various use cases and promoting inclusivity across the Sonr ecosystem.

* Support seamless integration and minimal disruption for existing app developers and users, while preserving the value and utility of the Sonr token in securing the network.

###

### **Unstable Regulatory Environment**

The decentralized identity solution space is not yet fully understood or regulated by governmental bodies. Changes in law or regulatory enforcement could have a significant impact on the utility and value of $SNR tokens and the Sonr network.

###### **Solution - **Proactive Engagement with Regulatory Bodies

* Sonr actively monitors regulatory developments and engages with policymakers to help shape a regulatory environment that is conducive to decentralized identity solutions. Regulatory compliance is not only legally essential but also fosters trust among consumers and stakeholders. Therefore, a multi-faceted approach to regulatory engagement is integral to Sonr's business model.

* Transparency is crucial when navigating the complexities of regulations governing digital identities and blockchain technologies. Sonr maintains an open line of communication with relevant regulatory bodies, ensuring that any concerns or questions from either side can be promptly addressed. This relationship is not purely reactive; Sonr often seeks feedback in the developmental phase of new features or services to preemptively identify and address any regulatory issues.

###

### **Software Accessibility**

As a platform dealing with identity verification, Sonr might fall under future regulations for handling personal data. Complying with such regulations might require fundamental changes to the system architecture, leading to short-term disruptions and long-term uncertainties.

###### **Solution — **External** **Compliance Audits

* Sonr will conduct regular compliance audits, engaging legal and security firms to ensure adherence to upcoming laws, industry standards, and internal policies. This will include privacy, AML, and financial regulations, alongside security assessments to safeguard against potential breaches. Financial transactions and user experience will also be audited, aiming to bolster stakeholder trust and enhance user satisfaction.

###

### **Security Vulnerabilities**

While Sonr uses state-of-the-art technologies to ensure network security, no system is entirely immune from the risk of cyber-attacks, including 51% attacks, phishing attacks, and other types of cybercrime.

###### **Solution** — State of the Art Cryptographic System

* Sonr's platform uses MPC for data privacy, allowing secure, private joint computations. It also employs quantum-resistant encryption to protect against future quantum threats, ensuring user data and transactions remain secure. Additionally, Sonr integrates biometric and WebAuthn technologies for secure, user-friendly digital identity management.

###

### **Network Scalability**

As the Sonr network grows, it will require more resources to ensure the system can handle a larger number of transactions, identities, and data points without performance issues.

###### **Solution** - Hexagonal Software Architecture

* Sonr operates on a layered architecture, allowing different components of the network to scale independently. This approach not only increases efficiency but also allows us to implement localized optimizations. For example, identity verification can scale differently from transaction processing or data storage, each optimized for their specific needs.
