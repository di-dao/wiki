# Token Value Accural

As the Sonr ecosystem grows and expands, the value of SNR tokens will accrue in a number of ways. Through the development of new use cases, the controlled release of tokens, and the implementation of staking and vesting mechanisms, Sonr aims to create a strong and stable token economy that benefits all stakeholders. The SNR token will be used to facilitate a range of functions within the Sonr ecosystem, including staking, payment for verification services, access to premium features, interchain security, and wider Cosmos ecosystem interaction. By providing tangible benefits to token holders, Sonr aims to foster an engaged and committed community that is invested in the long-term success of the platform. The token value accrual section details how SONR token's value will be determined and sustained over time. This could include discussions on the token's inflation rate, deflationary mechanisms, and how SONR tokens can maintain long-term value.

**Mechanisms for Growth**

* **Staking Rewards:**Secure the network and earn rewards by staking tokens to support validators

* **Platform Services**: use various services within the Sonr ecosystem, such as identity verification and data storage

* **Developer Incentives:**Reward developers for building and maintaining applications on the Sonr platform

* **Ecosystem Grants:**Fund projects, partnerships, and research initiatives that contribute to the growth and development of the Sonr ecosystem

##### **Value Capture**

Sonr's token value is designed to accrue through a variety of mechanisms as the ecosystem grows and expands. The value of SNR tokens will increase as demand for them rises due to their utility in the ecosystem. SNR tokens will be used for staking, payment for verification services, access to premium features, interchain security, and wider Cosmos ecosystem interaction. As more users, developers, and businesses integrate Sonr's decentralized identity solutions, demand for the token will grow due to its utility within the ecosystem.

Additionally, the controlled release of tokens, the implementation of staking and vesting mechanisms, and the development of new use cases will all contribute to the token's value accrual. 0.05% of each transaction fee is directed to the Sonr treasury, providing a sustainable source of funding for future platform improvements, ecosystem growth, and governance initiatives; 99.5% goes back to the validator. A portion of fees collected from transactions and services will be allocated to the Sonr treasury, enabling ongoing investment in ecosystem growth and supporting token value stability.

Finally, Sonr plans to implement a strategic buyback process, whereby a portion of the treasury funds is used to purchase Sonr tokens from the open market, effectively reducing the circulating supply and demonstrating the project's ongoing commitment to its growth and success. By providing tangible benefits to token holders, Sonr aims to foster an engaged and committed community that is invested in the long-term success of the platform.

# Deriving Token Utility

The value of the SNR token is primarily derived from its utility within the Sonr network. As the native currency, SNR is required to access and use various services in the ecosystem, driving demand for the token. Additionally, the token's value is intrinsically linked to the growth and success of the network - the more applications and users that join, the greater the demand for SNR.

As the Sonr ecosystem grows and expands, the value of SNR tokens will accrue in a number of ways. Through the development of new use cases, the controlled release of tokens, and the implementation of staking and vesting mechanisms, By providing tangible benefits to token holders, Sonr aims to foster an engaged and committed community that is invested in the long-term success of the platform. Here are the mechanisms for long term & sustainable growth:

1. **Demand for Platform Services**: The primary driver of value accrual is the demand for services offered within the Sonr network. As the range and quality of services increase, more users and developers are attracted to the platform, enhancing the value of SNR tokens due to increased demand.

2. **Network Security and Governance**: Token holders who contribute to network security by running validators or participating in governance activities receive staking rewards in the form of SNR tokens. This not only incentivizes active participation but also accrues value to the token by effectively reducing its circulating supply.

3. **Staking and Delegation**: SNR tokens can be staked or delegated to validators, earning staking rewards over time. This function serves to accrue value to the tokens by incentivizing holding, thus reducing sell pressure and increasing scarcity.

4. **Developer Incentives:**Reward developers for building and maintaining applications on the Sonr platform

5. **Ecosystem Grants:**Fund projects, partnerships, and research initiatives that contribute to the growth and development of the Sonr ecosystem

6. **Interchain Transactions**: As a Cosmos-based network, Sonr enables Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), allowing SNR to be transacted across different blockchain networks. This function can increase the liquidity and utility of SNR, thereby contributing to its value accrual.

# **Token Value Flow**

Value flow in the Sonr ecosystem refers to the movement of value in terms of SNR tokens among various stakeholders, processes, and components of the system. It is crucial for maintaining the network's economic balance and functionality.

The controlled release of tokens, the implementation of staking and vesting mechanisms, and the development of new use cases will all contribute to the token's value accrual. 0.05% of each transaction fee is directed to the Sonr treasury, providing a sustainable source of funding for future platform improvements, ecosystem growth, and governance initiatives; 99.5% goes back to the validator. A portion of fees collected from transactions and services will be allocated to the Sonr treasury, enabling ongoing investment in ecosystem growth and supporting token value stability.

Here's an explanation of several key elements contributing to Sonr's value flow:

1. **Payment Escrow**: This system ensures secure transactions between users. When a user requests a service, the corresponding payment is locked in escrow. Upon successful completion of the service, the payment is released to the service provider. This not only fosters trust but also maintains a healthy flow of SNR tokens within the ecosystem.

2. **Treasury**: The treasury plays a crucial role in funding development projects and initiatives that are beneficial to the Sonr network. It accumulates funds through various sources such as transaction fees, penalties, and protocol revenues, which are then used to support the growth and enhancement of the network.

3. **Buyback Process**: Periodic buybacks of SNR tokens using the protocol revenues serve to reduce the circulating supply of tokens, creating scarcity and potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens. Sonr plans to implement a strategic buyback process, whereby a portion of the treasury funds is used to purchase Sonr tokens from the open market, effectively reducing the circulating supply, ensuring constant demand, and demonstrating the project's ongoing commitment to its growth and success.

4. **Linear Vesting Schedule**: SNR tokens awarded to team members, early contributors, and other stakeholders follow a linear vesting schedule. This mechanism not only secures their long-term commitment but also manages the flow of tokens into the market, preventing abrupt oversupply.

5. **Order Stack**: The order stack, a component of Sonr's decentralized exchange, regulates the trading of SNR tokens. By enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions, it facilitates a more efficient and equitable token flow.

6. **Highway Protocol**: The Highway Protocol handles interchain transactions, enabling the flow of SNR tokens across different blockchains. By providing a secure and efficient channel for cross-chain transfers, it enhances the liquidity and utility of SNR tokens.

In essence, Sonr's value flow is an interconnected network of processes and mechanisms designed to maintain the platform's economic stability, encourage active participation, and promote the growth of the ecosystem. Each component plays a unique role, and their effective functioning collectively supports the sustained value and utility of SNR tokens.
