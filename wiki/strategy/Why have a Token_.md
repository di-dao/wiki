# Why have a Token?

Tokenomics is a pivotal aspect of our ecosystem. Our token model is carefully designed to ensure the balanced growth of the network, drive user engagement, incentivize key stakeholders, and reinforce network security. In essence, it forms the backbone of our efforts to democratize identity management and create an all-inclusive, user-centric ecosystem.

The SNR token is not just a form of digital currency; it embodies multiple roles to stimulate active participation, foster trust and align the interests of all stakeholders. Below are the primary reasons why we need the SNR token and its key functions in the Sonr ecosystem:

* **Incentive Mechanism: **In a decentralized network like Sonr, the SNR token is used to incentivize and reward various stakeholders, including validators, developers, and end-users for their active participation and contributions. By providing tangible benefits to token holders, Sonr aims to foster an engaged and committed community that is invested in the long-term success of the platform.

* **Network Security: **The SNR token is used to secure the network. Validators 'stake' SNR tokens to propose and validate transactions. This stake can be lost if they act maliciously, thus providing a strong incentive for validators to maintain the security and integrity of the network.

* **Cosmos Ecosystem Interaction: **SNR tokens will facilitate wider Cosmos ecosystem interaction with Sonr IDs over IBC. This functionality will open up new avenues of collaboration and interoperability, pushing the boundaries of what's achievable in the blockchain space. Essentially, SONR tokens will be used to enable cross-ecosystem transactions, making it easier for users to interact with other projects within the Cosmos ecosystem.

* **Governance: **Tokens provide a democratic means to allow token holders to participate in the decision-making process of the Sonr ecosystem, reinforcing decentralization.

* **Payment for Verification Services:**SNR tokens will be used to pay for verification services provided by validators. Validators will be required to stake SONR tokens to participate in the network's consensus process. In return, validators will earn rewards for their contributions.

#### **Functions of the SNR Token:**

* **Utility Token: **SNR tokens are used within the Sonr ecosystem to access and use various services such as creating new identities, invoking service calls, and storing data.

* **Governance Token: **SNR token holders have voting rights in the Sonr ecosystem. They can participate in the governance process to influence the development and future direction of Sonr.

* **Reward Token: **Validators receive SNR tokens as rewards for processing transactions and maintaining the network. Likewise, developers can earn tokens for building valuable applications on the Sonr platform.

# Means of Payment

On Sonr’s blockchain all transactional operations are for either managing a user’s account or a application configuration. This is to maintain a distributed ledger of users and the apps they can interact with to ensure an open decentralized standard for the user owned internet.

> **Demand: **Obtain goods and services on or off-chain in exchange for transfer of the token
> **Supply**: Tokens available to use for the purchase of goods and services.

### Registry

The registry module houses our standard for User and Application identification. We utilize the combined encryption technology native to the user’s devices to secure their identity effectively on the internet without the use of passwords and seed phrases.

* **Creating a User**

* **Modifying User Account**

* **Registering an Application**

* **Updating Application Settings**

* **Buying an Alias**

* **Listing an Alias for Sale**

* **Transferring an Alias**

### Schema

The schema module records all the type definitions in a particular application powered by the Sonr Network. It provides a reliable way for nodes to be able to resolve and utilize data types across the network in a verifiable and decentralized way.

* **Defining a Schema**

* **Updating a Schema**

* **Deleting a Schema**

* **Classify Schema into NFT Collection**

* **Modifying the Schema Classification**

* **Minting NFT from Schema**

* **Burning Existing NFTs**

* **Updating a User’s NFT Properties**

On Sonr we will be leveraging a**delegate stake**mechanism in order to**optimize buy-in**for users in the network. It imposes an**excess opportunity cost**if**slashing**is implemented.

* **Demand: **Obtain rewards, goods, or services through staking or locking up the token.

* **Supply**: Tokens staked or locked up.

With this being said, there are some challenges in implementing staking:

* The token must already have value

* Allocating power or influence via staking gives major edge to wealthy users

* They are frequently subject to gaming and coordination problems

However there is substantial benefit in incorporating a staking mechanism, with the following criteria met we can create a sustainable design:

1. The upfront capital required to stake should not significantly discourage them to stake

2. If a stakeholder group is making decisions that materially harm the network, they would be punished via slashing the stake.

3. Stakeholders can make decisions that positively impact the future network health and token price, therefore holding stake can promote positive Sonr growth
