# Network Governance

SONR token holders will play an active role in the governance of the Sonr ecosystem. The governance section outlines how SONR token holders can participate in the decision-making process of the Sonr ecosystem. This includes discussions on how token holders can vote on proposals, how the network's consensus is formed, and how token holders can participate in network upgrades.

## Voting on Proposals

SONR token holders will have the ability to participate in the governance of the Sonr ecosystem through a transparent and decentralized voting system. Token holders will be able to vote on proposals related to the development and management of the ecosystem, including changes to the token economics, platform upgrades, and other key decisions.

Proposals will be submitted to the community for review and discussion. Once they have been thoroughly vetted, they will be put to a vote by SONR token holders. Token holders will be able to cast their votes directly or delegate their voting power to a trusted party.

## Network Consensus

The Sonr network will operate on a delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Validators will be required to stake SONR tokens to participate in the consensus process. This mechanism ensures that only the most committed validators are participating in the consensus process, which strengthens the overall security of the system.

Token holders will be able to participate in the consensus process by staking their tokens. In return, they will earn rewards for their contributions to network security and reliability.

## Software Upgrades

The Sonr ecosystem will be designed to facilitate network upgrades and improvements in a transparent and decentralized manner. Token holders will be able to propose upgrades to the network, which will be subject to community review and discussion. Once approved by the community, upgrades will be implemented through a decentralized consensus process, with SONR token holders having the final say in the decision-making process.

Through these governance mechanisms, SONR token holders will have an active role in shaping the direction and development of the Sonr ecosystem. By fostering an engaged and committed community, Sonr aims to create a sustainable and decentralized identity verification system that benefits all stakeholders.

## Stakeholder Mapping

The following is an overview of the different actors and stakeholders who will interact with the Sonr network:

### **Key Actors**

* **Validators:**Validators are essential for maintaining the security and consensus of the Sonr network. Validators will be required to stake SNR tokens to participate in the network's consensus process. In return, validators will earn rewards for their contributions, ensuring that only the most committed validators are participating in the consensus process, which strengthens the overall security of the system.

* **Developers:**Developers will play a vital role in expanding the use cases of the Sonr network. By integrating Sonr's technology into their applications, developers can use tokens for platform services and app-related fees. Developers will be incentivized to build and deploy applications on Sonr through ecosystem grants and developer incentives, driving innovation and expanding the value of the ecosystem.

* **Stakers:**Stakers will contribute to the security of the Sonr network by delegating SNR tokens to support validators. Stakers will earn staking rewards and participate in governance, providing long-term commitment and alignment of interests, contributing to the overall stability and security of the network.

**Other Participants**

* **End Users:**End users will be able to interact with Sonr-based applications, using tokens for various services within the ecosystem. End users will drive demand for Sonr's services, contributing to the overall growth and adoption of the ecosystem.

* **Token Holders:**Token holders will support the growth and stability of the Sonr ecosystem by investing in Sonr's growth, participating in governance decisions, and influencing the platform's direction.

* **Enterprises:**Enterprises will strengthen the ecosystem by contributing and fostering new partnerships, expanding the use cases of the Sonr network, and driving adoption of the token.

# Role of Foundation

The Sonr Foundation, along with other key participants, will ensure fair and transparent governance, fostering trust among token holders and stakeholders. Governance subsidies, ecosystem grants, and node subsidies will be used to incentivize active participation in governance and promote long-term engagement and commitment.

Sonr's gradual release strategy will allocate tokens to various stakeholders (validators, developers, stakers, etc.) over time, ensuring a fair and balanced distribution. Incentivized participation through governance subsidies, ecosystem grants, and node subsidies will encourage long-term engagement and commitment, promoting the overall growth and success of the Sonr ecosystem.
