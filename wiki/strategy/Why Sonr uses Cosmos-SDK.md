# Why Sonr uses Cosmos-SDK

# The Decision for Cosmos: Why It Matters

Cosmos is a blockchain ecosystem that enables different blockchains to interoperate with each other. It provides a scalable, customizable, and interoperable environment, which is crucial for a solution like Sonr, where decentralization and interoperability are key elements.

* **Interoperability:**Cosmos is built to connect multiple blockchains, allowing them to communicate, share data, and transact with one another. This interoperability ensures that dapps built on Sonr are not confined to a single blockchain but can seamlessly operate and transfer value across the broader Cosmos ecosystem.

* **Scalability:**Through its unique consensus model (Tendermint BFT) and the use of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, Cosmos offers a solution to some of the pressing scalability issues faced by many blockchain platforms today. This means dapps on Sonr can handle a larger volume of transactions without compromising on speed or efficiency.

* **Customizability:**Cosmos enables the creation of tailor-made blockchains using the Cosmos SDK. This ensures that Sonr can be optimized specifically for dapp development, providing developers with a toolkit designed for their unique needs.

* **Sovereignty:**Each blockchain in the Cosmos network retains its governance mechanism, meaning decisions affecting one blockchain don’t impact others. This autonomy ensures that Sonr can adapt its governance and economic policies in response to its community's needs, without external influences.

* **Security and Sustainability:**Cosmos uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which not only reduces the environmental impact compared to proof-of-work systems but also provides robust security. This ensures that dapps on Sonr operate in a secure and eco-friendly environment.



By leveraging these features offered by Cosmos, Sonr can provide a robust, scalable, and highly interoperable digital identity solution that can be easily integrated across various systems and applications. This reinforces our value proposition of offering a secure, decentralized identity solution that is not only efficient and reliable but also versatile enough to accommodate future developments in the blockchain ecosystem.

4. ValidatorSet: The ValidatorSet component maintains a list of active validators in the network. It includes methods for selecting and rotating validators based on their staking power and performance.

**Use Cases**

1. Validator Selection: The Staking module manages the process of selecting validators who are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks. It facilitates the process by which validators are chosen based on the amount of tokens staked and other criteria.

2. Delegation: The Staking module enables users to delegate their tokens to validators, allowing them to participate in the consensus process and earn rewards for their contribution. Users can delegate their tokens to one or more validators, depending on their preferences and risk tolerance.

3. Redelegation: The Staking module allows users to redelegate their tokens from one validator to another without going through an unbonding period. This enables users to switch between validators more easily, allowing them to optimize their staking strategy.

4. Unbonding: The Staking module manages the unbonding process, allowing users to withdraw their delegated tokens and associated rewards. During the unbonding period, users' tokens are locked and cannot be used for other purposes.

5. Validator Rewards and Commission: The Staking module handles the distribution of block rewards and transaction fees to validators and delegators. Validators can set a commission rate, which is a percentage of the rewards they receive that they keep for themselves before distributing the remaining rewards to their delegators.

6. Slashing: The Staking module enforces the slashing mechanism, which penalizes validators for malicious behavior or downtime. This ensures the security and stability of the network by discouraging bad actors and encouraging validators to maintain high-quality infrastructure.

7. Governance Participation: The Staking module facilitates the participation of token holders in the governance process of the blockchain network. Token holders can vote on proposals, such as protocol upgrades or parameter changes, based on their delegated stake.

**Governance**

The Governance module includes several key components:

1. Proposal: The Proposal component defines the structure of proposals in the network. It includes fields such as the proposal type, content, and voting period.

2. ProposalHandler: The ProposalHandler component processes incoming proposals, verifying that they meet the network’s requirements and adding them to the voting period.

3. Vote: The Vote component manages the voting process for proposals. It includes methods for creating and casting votes, and for tallying and verifying the results.

4. GovernanceKeeper: The GovernanceKeeper is responsible for managing the governance process in the network. It includes methods for creating, querying, and updating proposals, as well as enforcing the network’s governance rules and policies.

**Use Cases**

1. Proposal Submission: The Governance module allows users to submit proposals for various changes or improvements to the blockchain network. Proposals can include parameter changes, software upgrades, or modifications to the governance process itself.

2. Proposal Voting: The Governance module enables token holders to vote on proposals submitted by other users. Token holders can cast their votes based on the amount of tokens they hold or have delegated, ensuring that the voting process is fair and proportional to the user's stake in the network.

3. Proposal Deposit: The Governance module may require users to deposit a certain amount of tokens when submitting a proposal. This deposit serves as an incentive for users to submit meaningful and well-thought-out proposals, as the deposit can be forfeited if the proposal does not receive sufficient support.

4. Proposal Evaluation: The Governance module provides tools and mechanisms for evaluating proposals, such as tallying votes, determining whether a proposal has met the minimum quorum, and assessing whether the proposal has received the required level of support to be considered approved or rejected.

5. Proposal Execution: If a proposal is approved by the token holders, the Governance module is responsible for executing the changes proposed. This can include updating parameters, initiating software upgrades, or modifying the governance process as needed.

6. Emergency Governance: The Governance module can be used to handle emergency situations that require immediate intervention or decisions. This might include situations like critical security vulnerabilities or other unforeseen issues that require urgent attention.

7. Community Fund Management: The Governance module can be used to manage a community fund, where token holders can submit proposals for funding specific projects or initiatives that benefit the network. Token holders can vote on funding proposals, ensuring that resources are allocated based on community consensus.

**Slashing**

The Slashing module includes several key components:

1. Validator: The Validator component defines the structure of validator nodes in the network. It includes fields such as the validator’s address, public key, and staking power.

2. Slash: The Slash component is responsible for enforcing the network’s slashing rules and policies. It includes methods for detecting malicious behavior, such as double-signing or equivocation, and for imposing penalties on the offending validators.

3. SlashKeeper: The SlashKeeper is responsible for managing the slashing process in the network. It includes methods for detecting and processing slash events, as well as for updating the validator set and distributing penalties.

4. SlashingParams: The SlashingParams component defines the network’s slashing parameters and policies, such as the maximum penalty amount and the duration of the slashing period.

**Use Cases**

1. Downtime Punishment: The Slashing module monitors validator uptime and penalizes validators who fail to meet a minimum level of participation in the consensus process. This ensures that validators maintain reliable infrastructure and actively contribute to the network's security.

2. Double Signing Punishment: The Slashing module detects and punishes validators who engage in equivocation, or double signing. Equivocation occurs when a validator signs two conflicting messages (such as two different block proposals) within the same consensus round. This malicious behavior is detrimental to the network's security and is heavily penalized.

3. Custom Misbehavior Detection: Developers can use the Slashing module to define custom types of misbehavior and corresponding penalties. This enables blockchain networks to implement additional security measures tailored to their specific requirements and potential threats.

4. Validator Jailing: The Slashing module can temporarily "jail" validators who engage in malicious behavior or fail to meet performance requirements. While jailed, a validator cannot participate in the consensus process and must address the issues that led to their jailing before they can resume their validator duties.

5. Incentivizing Validator Performance: By enforcing penalties for poor performance or malicious behavior, the Slashing module creates incentives for validators to maintain high-quality infrastructure and actively contribute to the network's security. This helps ensure the long-term stability and integrity of the PoS blockchain.

6. Delegator Protection: The Slashing module also protects delegators by imposing penalties on validators who engage in malicious behavior or fail to meet performance requirements. By slashing a portion of the validator's staked tokens, the module discourages bad actors and encourages delegators to choose reliable validators.

# Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)

The future of blockchain technology lies not in isolated, individual chains, but in a dynamic, interoperable network of multiple blockchains, capable of communicating and interacting with each other seamlessly. The Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, or IBC, is a pioneering technology that lays the groundwork for such a vision.

## What is IBC?

The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol in Cosmos is a complex, yet well-structured process that facilitates the secure and efficient transfer of data and digital assets between different blockchain networks (known as 'zones') connected through the Cosmos Hub. The following is a high-level overview of how IBC works:

1. **IBC Client Creation**: For two blockchains to communicate, each needs to establish an IBC client on the other. This client monitors the state of the other blockchain and verifies that the data it's receiving is from a valid block.

2. **Connection Establishment**: Once IBC clients are set up, a connection is established between the two blockchains. This involves a handshake protocol where each blockchain confirms that it has permission to establish and maintain the connection.

3. **Channel Creation**: A channel is then created within the connection. The channel serves as a pathway for packet transfer between the two blockchains, with each channel assigned to a specific connection.

4. **Packet Transfer**: Packets of information (which could be token transfers, data, or even function calls) are sent from one blockchain to another through the established channel. The sending blockchain commits to a packet, the receiving blockchain acknowledges the packet, and then the sender receives proof that the packet has been received.

5. **Packet Ordering**: IBC supports both ordered and unordered channels. In an ordered channel, packets are expected to be processed in the order they were sent, whereas in an unordered channel, packets can be processed in any order.

6. **IBC Modules**: IBC Modules are the application-layer modules that define the packets and the logic for how packets are handled. An example is the ICS20 (IBC token transfer) standard that outlines how to transfer tokens from one blockchain to another via IBC.

7. **Relayers**: Relayers are off-chain processes that monitor the state of two blockchains and relay the necessary proofs between them to facilitate packet transmission.

IBC, in essence, provides a secure and efficient infrastructure for cross-chain communication, while leaving the application-specific implementation details to the IBC modules. Its flexible design allows for a wide variety of cross-chain interactions, expanding the capabilities of blockchain networks beyond their individual scopes. It's a pivotal component in the Cosmos ecosystem, underpinning its vision of an 'Internet of Blockchains'.

## **Why IBC is Important for Sonr**

1. **Scalability and Efficiency**: As Sonr continues to grow, scalability becomes a priority. With IBC, Sonr can execute transactions and share data across different blockchains. This expands the capacity of the Sonr network beyond the constraints of a single chain, offering enhanced scalability and operational efficiency.

2. **Interoperability**: IBC fosters interoperability, enabling Sonr to interact and transact with different blockchain networks. This is vital for Sonr, as it opens up a wide range of possibilities for partnerships, integrations, and access to diverse assets and services within the broader blockchain ecosystem.

3. **Decentralization and Security**: By enabling communication between different blockchains, IBC furthers the decentralization of the Sonr network. With multiple chains involved, the security of the network is reinforced, as an attack or failure on one chain does not impact the others.

4. **Growth and Adoption**: With IBC, Sonr can tap into larger, more diverse user bases and markets. By connecting with multiple blockchain networks, Sonr exposes its platform and services to new audiences and potential users, thereby promoting growth and increasing adoption.

## **The Role of IBC in Sonr**

Within the Sonr network, IBC acts as a connector, facilitating the flow of data and transactions between different blockchains. This could involve anything from transferring SONR tokens between chains, to requesting and receiving services from different chains in the network. Moreover, IBC enables cross-chain identity verification, making the user experience seamless across the different chains in the Sonr ecosystem.

In summary, IBC is not just a feature within Sonr—it's a key part of Sonr's vision for a robust, interconnected, and decentralized ecosystem for digital identity and services. It represents a fundamental shift in how blockchain networks operate and interact, offering immense potential for growth, scalability, and interoperability in the years to come.

# Cosmos SDK Tooling

> The following packages and tools are used to simplify the development of the Sonr Blockchain.

## ORM Tables

### **Key Features of Cosmos SDK ORM**

* **Protobuf Annotations**: The ORM uses protobuf annotations to define table structures, which allows for the generation of corresponding Go code that handles the database operations[7](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/architecture/adr-055-orm).

* **Optimized Storage**: When storing primary key records, the ORM avoids repeating values in the primary key to save storage space. For example, if an object has a primary key**`a`**, it will be stored as**`Key: 'a', Value: rest_of_the_object`**[7](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/architecture/adr-055-orm).

* **Sorted and Unsorted Indexes**: The ORM supports sorted indexes for simple protobuf types (except for a few like bytes, enum, float, double) as well as**`Timestamp`**and**`Duration`**. It also supports unsorted indexes[7](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/architecture/adr-055-orm).

* **Performance**: The generated code from**`cosmos/cosmos-proto`**does optimizations around the**`protoreflect`**API to enhance performance[7](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/architecture/adr-055-orm).

### **Integration with Cosmos SDK Modules**

Cosmos SDK modules can be seen as state machines within the larger blockchain state machine. They define a subset of the state and a subset of message types, which are routed to a module's Protobuf Msg service. The ORM tooling is integrated into this architecture to handle data persistence and querying within these modules.

### **Protobuf and Cosmos SDK**

The Cosmos SDK uses Protobuf extensively for various purposes, including:

* **Client and Server Code Generation**: Protobuf definitions are used to generate client and server code, which simplifies the development process[13](https://ida.interchain.io/academy/2-cosmos-concepts/4-messages.html).

* **Transaction Encoding**: Protobuf is used for transaction encoding within the Cosmos SDK, as outlined in ADR 020[12](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/architecture/adr-020-protobuf-transaction-encoding).

* **Msg Services**: Protobuf service definitions are leveraged for defining**`Msg`**services, which improves developer experience[8](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/architecture/adr-031-msg-service).

### Defining Tables

To define a table:

1. create a .proto file to describe the module's state (naming it`state.proto`is recommended for consistency),
   and import "cosmos/orm/v1/orm.proto", ex:

```Plain&#x20;Text
syntax = "proto3";
package bank_example;

import "cosmos/orm/v1/orm.proto";


```

1. define a`message`for the table, ex:

```Plain&#x20;Text
message Balance {
  bytes account = 1;
  string denom = 2;
  uint64 balance = 3;
}


```

1. add the`cosmos.orm.v1.table`option to the table and give the table an`id`unique within this .proto file:

```Plain&#x20;Text
message Balance {
  option (cosmos.orm.v1.table) = {
    id: 1
  };

  bytes account = 1;
  string denom = 2;
  uint64 balance = 3;
}


```

1. define the primary key field or fields, as a comma-separated list of the fields from the message which should make
   up the primary key:

```Plain&#x20;Text
message Balance {
  option (cosmos.orm.v1.table) = {
    id: 1
    primary_key: { fields: "account,denom" }
  };

  bytes account = 1;
  string denom = 2;
  uint64 balance = 3;
}


```

1. add any desired secondary indexes by specifying an`id`unique within the table and a comma-separate list of the
   index fields:

```Plain&#x20;Text
message Balance {
  option (cosmos.orm.v1.table) = {
    id: 1;
    primary_key: { fields: "account,denom" }
    index: { id: 1 fields: "denom" } // this allows querying for the accounts which own a denom
  };

  bytes account = 1;
  string denom   = 2;
  uint64 amount  = 3;
}


```

### Auto-incrementing Primary Keys

A common pattern in SDK modules and in database design is to define tables with a single integer`id`field with an
automatically generated primary key. In the ORM we can do this by setting the`auto_increment`option to`true`on the
primary key, ex:

```Plain&#x20;Text
message Account {
  option (cosmos.orm.v1.table) = {
    id: 2;
    primary_key: { fields: "id", auto_increment: true }
  };

  uint64 id = 1;
  bytes address = 2;
}


```

### Unique Indexes

A unique index can be added by setting the`unique`option to`true`on an index, ex:

```Plain&#x20;Text
message Account {
  option (cosmos.orm.v1.table) = {
    id: 2;
    primary_key: { fields: "id", auto_increment: true }
    index: {id: 1, fields: "address", unique: true}
  };

  uint64 id = 1;
  bytes address = 2;
}


```

### Singletons

The ORM also supports a special type of table with only one row called a`singleton`. This can be used for storing
module parameters. Singletons only need to define a unique`id`and that cannot conflict with the id of other
tables or singletons in the same .proto file. Ex:

```Plain&#x20;Text
message Params {
  option (cosmos.orm.v1.singleton) = {
    id: 3;
  };

  google.protobuf.Duration voting_period = 1;
  uint64 min_threshold = 2;
}


```

# Interchain Modules

> The following packages and modules provided by the cosmos sdk are used to construct the`x/identity`module.

## IBCAccounts

The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is a standard that allows different blockchain systems to communicate with each other. Within the context of the Cosmos SDK, IBCAccount Hosts and Controllers are components that facilitate the management of accounts over an IBC channel[1](https://hackmd.io/@jJbjHFtsTv-tmqQMEKRVVg/BJOKCJ4Kd). The IBCAccount Hosts and Controllers are part of the ICS-27 specification, which outlines the packet data structure, state machine handling logic, and encoding details for the account management system over an IBC channel

The IBCAccount module sends IBC packets to other IBCAccount modules. Helper modules consume the IBCAccount keeper and call the keeper functions directly. For example, registering an account is done through the IBCAccount keeper. There have been discussions about potential updates to the ICS-27 specification, particularly in relation to authentication improvement. The primary user story guiding these discussions is the registration of an interchain account. In terms of implementation, the final callback is done on the helper module side of things, which complicates the implementation as there are no guidelines for this

## IBCTokenTransfer

### **Functionality**

The IBC Token Transfer Module is a key component of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, specifically implementing the ICS-20 standard, which enables cross-chain fungible token transfers. This module allows tokens to be transferred between different blockchains that have implemented the IBC protocol, which is a significant feature for the Cosmos ecosystem and other IBC-compatible blockchains

.When a token is transferred from one chain to another, the source chain escrows the tokens and sends a proof of this escrow to the destination chain. The destination chain then mints a representation of these tokens, allowing them to be used within its ecosystem. To return the tokens to their original chain, they must be sent back along the exact route they came from. If a channel in the chain history closes before the token can be sent back, the token cannot be returned to its original form

### **Security**

Security in the IBC Token Transfer Module is paramount. No other module must be capable of minting tokens with the`ibc/`prefix, which is reserved for the IBC transfer module. This ensures that only the IBC module can create tokens within a specific subset of the denomination space. The IBC protocol also relies on light clients for verifying cross-chain transactions without intermediaries, and it implements fault isolation mechanisms to limit damage from potential malicious behavior

### **Use Cases**

The IBC Token Transfer Module has several use cases, particularly in the realm of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It enables cross-chain transfers of tokens, which can be used in various applications such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), payment platforms, and other DeFi primitives. For instance, users can transfer tokens to a DEX, swap them, and potentially send the swapped tokens to another chain. Middleware solutions are also being explored to encode additional information, like trade orders, into the transfer packet, which could facilitate more complex operations like atomic swaps
