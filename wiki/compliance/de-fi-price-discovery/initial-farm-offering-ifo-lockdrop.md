  In this model, new tokens are distributed via yield farming or locking up
  tokens. Users provide liquidity to a pool or protocol TVL and in return, they
  get the new tokens

# Initial Farm Offering (IFO) / Lockdrop

High APRs are often used to attract liquidity/TVL this way, but sustainability of this model is often questionable, and should hence be used with care/only to bootstrap the protocol.

## Adoption Rate

Lockdrop and IFOs have been around since the DeFi Summer 2021 and have been used by a variety of mostly DeFi related projects. Examples in Cosmos include Astroport DEXs initial launch on Terra.

## **Timing**

IFOs and Lockdrops are usually conducted right when/after the project launches and are therefore part of the project's launch sequence.

## **Initiator of the Sale**

The Lockdrop & IFOs may be initiated by the project team itself. In order to launch the token and conduct the sale/distribution in a more decentralized manner is to initiate the sale via a governance proposal. This will only work however, if tokens have already been launched and are already held by users, e.g. via a prior airdrop.

## **Flow of Funds**

Funds raised from an Lockdrop are directed towards certain protocol functions which the liquidity was intended for. Examples may be liquidity for LP, protocol TVL or lending.

## **Who Can Invest**

Technically anyone can invest. However, certain projects may impose restrictions based on geographic location or other criteria to comply with local regulations.

## **Decentralization**

Due to little to no restrictions into who can participate, this price discovery mechanism has a high chance of distributing tokens into a variety of users hands, however, this is not necessarily a given as it also depends on the terms of the lockdrop, and how appealing it is to a wide user base. If the IFO is not initiated by the founding team or project and the funds flow into a protocol owned pool this mechanism is relatively decentralized.
