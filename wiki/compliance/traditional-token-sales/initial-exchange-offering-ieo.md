# Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)

Unlike ICOs, where the project team conducts the sale themselves, in an IEO, the exchange acts as the intermediary and conducts the token sale on behalf of the project. This provides more security for investors, as the exchange typically vets the projects before listing, reducing the risk of scams to some extent.

## **Adoption Rate**

IEOs gained significant popularity as a successor to ICOs. Exchanges started hosting IEOs on their platforms to attract more users and provide a safer token sale environment. IEOs have been well-received by both projects and investors due to the benefits they offer in terms of trust, convenience, and exposure to a large user base.

## **Timing**

IEOs are conducted on cryptocurrency exchanges, and the timing is determined by the exchange and the project team. The exchange typically vets and selects projects to participate in the IEO, and the token sale takes place on a specific date and time set by the exchange. IEOs can be conducted during the launch phase but listings might be done at a later stage on different exchanges.

## **Initiator of the Sale**

IEOs are initiated by the cryptocurrency exchange platform hosting the token sale. The exchange collaborates with the project and facilitates the token sale process on its platform.

## **Flow of Funds**

In IEOs, the funds raised during the token sale flow through the cryptocurrency exchange hosting the IEO. The exchange acts as an intermediary and facilitates the token sale process. Investors participating in the IEO send their contributions to the exchange's designated wallet. The project team receives the funds raised during the token sale through a designated wallet on the cryptocurrency exchange platform hosting the IEO. The project receives the funds through different options for fund disbursement, which can include direct transfers to the project team's wallet, staged releases based on milestones, or holding funds in a smart contract escrow with predefined conditions for release.

## **Who Can Invest**

IEOs are generally open to all users of the hosting exchange. Investors need to create an account on the exchange platform and complete any necessary verification procedures to participate in the IEO.

## **Decentralization**

&#x20;IEOs offer a more centralized approach compared to ICOs, as the token sale process occurs on a specific cryptocurrency exchange platform. While the underlying blockchain technology may still be decentralized, the exchange's role as an intermediary introduces a level of centralization in the token sale process.
